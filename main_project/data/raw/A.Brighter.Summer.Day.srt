3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,207
My son's always done well in
Chinese literature. SUMMER 1959

4
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,927
He couldn't have scored just 50.

5
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,771
He got close to 100
in everything else.

6
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,881
There must be some mistake.

7
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,330
Mr. Wang is our friend as well.

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,966
He understands our procedure.

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,924
We'll double-check
your son's scores.

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,330
I'm afraid I can't show you
the exam papers.

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,762
It's against our regulations.

12
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,690
You idiot!
Hot tea in this weather?

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,609
I promise
to double-check his scores.

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,481
If the examination board
made any mistakes,

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,729
we'll make
any necessary adjustments.

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,161
You can trust me.

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,164
You know, night school
at Jianguo High isn't bad.

41
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,889
Millions of mainland Chinese
fled to Taiwan in 1949

42
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,567
with the Nationalist government
after its defeat in the civil war

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,921
by the Chinese Communists.

44
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,527
Their children were brought up
in an uneasy atmosphere

45
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,484
created by their parents'
uncertainty about the future.

46
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,251
Many formed street gangs
to search for an identity

47
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,170
and to strengthen
their sense of security.

48
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,410
SEPTEMBER 1960

49
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,400
Why this color?

50
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,287
Why worry about the color?

51
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,525
It's a black-and-white film!

52
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,486
How can I wear
such an awful color?

53
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,406
I told you to change, so change!

54
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,122
There's no dressing room.

55
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,130
I told you to change,
not to go nude!

56
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,170
What are you so upset for?
Move!

57
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,927
Didn't we agree on the dress?

58
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,125
Now you're changing things
on the spot!

59
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,929
Listen, everyone:
This is our last shot.

60
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,247
Let's get it over with!

61
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,723
Someone's up there!

62
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,003
Kid, what are you doing up there?

63
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,320
You're not getting away,
you little brat!

64
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,801
Think you can run away?

65
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,362
You should be in school.
What are you doing here?

66
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,603
What's your name?

67
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,202
Night school? What class?

68
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,046
I have ways to make you talk!

69
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,566
8-6-O-8-9.

70
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,211
Who's that? Don't run off!

71
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,962
Stay where you are!

72
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,042
Fucking kids! <i>I'll</i> kill you!

73
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,931
Smooch, smooch!

74
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,761
Have a kiss! Score a Miss!

75
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,888
Hanky-panky time!

76
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,363
<i>Attention.</i>

77
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,851
<i>Salute.</i>

78
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,689
<i>Be seated.</i>

79
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,967
<i>Hey, Airplane!
Fly over here!</i>

80
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,681
Where'd you get the flashlight?

81
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,684
Xiao Si'r snatched it
from the film studio.

82
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,287
Shut up, Underpants!
Stop asking about the test!

83
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,441
Panty, panty, flimsy and fancy!

84
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,166
If you get sweaty,
use it as a hanky.

85
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,527
Get one for your mommy!

86
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,167
Hush up. It's Red Bean.

87
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,169
Shine it on her.

88
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,731
Go on!

89
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,729
How's it work?

90
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,088
What are you little brats up to?

91
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,646
- I bet you they're red!
- Bullshit!

92
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,643
- Wanna bet?
- How much?

93
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,161
- Ten bucks.
- No, one.

94
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,324
- One buck?
- You call that a bet?

95
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,047
Shit, what a cheapskate!

96
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,606
You're too cheap to bet with.

97
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,848
You never pay up.

98
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,003
- Looks like somethings up.
- Must be something bad.

99
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,527
It's none of your damn business.

100
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,125
There's a fight.
Sly's cornered at the grade school.

101
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,084
Si'r, let me have that.
- Okay.

102
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,407
- Sex Bomb, we need your help.
- No problem.

103
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,921
- I'm not going.
- Who asked you?

104
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,883
Forget about him.
Let's go.

105
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,522
- He'll hit the porn stand again.
- Porn freak!

106
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,251
Hold it!

107
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,082
Sly, you okay?

108
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,685
Shit!

109
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,162
What took you so long?

110
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,889
Can't even take care
of our own turf!

111
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,361
Are we giving it up or what?

112
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,768
Got a smoke on you?

113
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,728
Hey, Deuce.

114
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,289
Shit! How did this happen?

115
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,724
They got me alone, that's all.

116
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,361
I held them off
by myself till now.

117
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,206
You try that next time.

118
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,846
I'm not blaming you.

119
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,729
But what are you
doing here so late?

120
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,161
None of your business.

121
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,887
How could we let the 217 gang
mess with our turf?

122
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,686
I tell you,
everyone's out to get us.

123
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,362
If it weren't the 217 boys,
it'd be others.

124
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,122
If your brother doesn't
come back soon, we're through.

125
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,524
- Honey's not here. I am.
- You are!

126
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,242
Please don't beat me up!

127
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,089
I'm sorry!
Don't beat me up!

128
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,248
I was just tagging along.

129
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,285
I'm not one of them.
We're not enemies!

130
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,726
So you two want to go big time?

131
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,930
This kid's too noisy.
Shut him up.

132
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,531
Don't hit me!

133
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,730
Watch closely.

134
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,008
Get a good look.

135
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,402
We don't need
chickenshit cowards.

136
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,130
Get up.

137
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,646
Get up!

138
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,883
Go back
and tell your big brother!

139
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,804
Never fuck
with the Little Park boys!

140
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,524
<i>Why are you switching
the lights on and off?</i>

141
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,010
My eyes go blurry.
I don't know why.

142
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,687
Get to bed earlier
and you'll be okay.

143
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,162
Why are you home so late?

144
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,810
We all stayed afterwards
to talk about the test.

145
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,441
<i>It won't work!
I can't button it!</i>

146
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,729
Make it work for now.
The bus is coming.

147
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,283
<i>Lao Er, why aren't you up?</i>

148
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,644
<i>Do I have to drag you
out of bed every day?</i>

149
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,649
Mom, it fell off!

150
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,731
There's no time to sew it on.
Use a pin for now.

151
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,322
<i>What's wrong?
Outgrew your clothes again?</i>

152
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,087
Mom, I can't find a pin!

153
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,520
<i>- I'm o“.
- Where are you going this early?</i>

154
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,610
<i>- We Saturday.
- It's too early even for Saturday.</i>

155
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,087
It's our class's turn
at the weekly meeting.

156
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,609
- No shoes in the house!
- I need my compass!

157
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,128
- Wow! Just out of the tub!
- What do they teach you!

158
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,369
You're like Americans,
bathing in the morning.

159
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,046
- It's none of your business!
- Let's go.

160
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,202
Good-bye.

161
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,890
I'll be available

162
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,010
every Saturday afternoon
at the infirmary.

163
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,124
I owe so much to my alma mater

164
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,285
and to Principal He
for what I've achieved today.

165
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,643
I honestly feel
I don't deserve this recognition.

166
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,367
I feel it's my duty to volunteer
to serve in your clinic.

167
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,483
Thank you.

168
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,407
Student 8-6-0-8-9!

169
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,121
Report to the conduct office
at once!

170
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,007
Those of you
who like baseball, listen up.

171
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,084
A day school student

172
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,931
hurt Mr. Chen yesterday
with a baseball bat.

173
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,088
Did you hear about it?

174
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,924
Starting today,

175
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,323
all baseball bats
must be registered.

176
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,524
All unregistered bats
will be confiscated.

177
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,449
You hear me?

178
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,762
<i>It was him! I'm positive!</i>

179
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,684
<i>I didn't take your flashlight.</i>

180
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,365
<i>Where's the other boy?</i>

181
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,806
<i>Who's the other boy?</i>

182
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,206
<i>We didn't mean any harm.</i>

183
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,288
He didn't take it, I swear.

184
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,488
- Were you with him yesterday?
- Yes.

185
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,688
Get over there!

186
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,925
- Was it you who broke my window?
- No.

187
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,008
What's going on?

188
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,441
Zhang Zhen was hanging
around the film studio.

189
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,403
Now somethings missing.

190
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,962
These students get
craftier every year.

191
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,602
But your film studio
is right next door.

192
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,968
No, thanks.

193
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,211
I can't solve
this problem for you.

194
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,402
Of course not.

195
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,170
A student cracked
a teacher's skull

196
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,487
with one of those recently.

197
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,170
It's a real problem!

198
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,324
You'd better come down
hard on them.

199
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,324
Our principal insists
on developing their free spirits.

200
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,522
Our school gate's never locked.

201
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,365
You better lock your gates tight.

202
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,524
You leave yours open,
and we'll leave ours open.

203
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,166
We can visit each other!

204
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,488
Why are you spreading
rumors about me?

205
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,170
What did I say?

206
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,489
You said I was with a girl
that night at the school.

207
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,682
You didn't see a thing,
understand?

208
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,531
- That's my seat.
- Take mine in the back.

209
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,203
<i>Salute.</i>

210
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,209
Let me copy off you.

211
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,520
Just see what happens
if you don't.

212
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,087
- Did you answer No. 4?
- Forget it. Let's play ball.

213
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Okay.

214
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,405
FUCK you!

215
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,442
Don't give me that look.

216
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,685
Wouldn't let me copy, huh?

217
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,006
Keep staring, tough guy.

218
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,881
Just try it. I dare you.

219
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,043
Hello, sir.

220
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,529
We're just playing around.

221
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,290
You boys enjoy
coming to my office?

222
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,326
If so,
I'm at your service anytime.

223
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,642
He's not your regular bookworm.

224
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,849
If you lock horns,
he doesn't fuck around.

225
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,648
What about my bat?

226
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,163
I'll get you another one.

227
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,482
I just bought that one.

228
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,609
Seventy bucks!

229
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,240
<i>Please deliver this, Uncle Fat.</i>

230
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,606
<i>You've got men in the family.
They can pick it up!</i>

231
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,924
Si?!

232
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,447
Stop drinking, will you?

233
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,443
You'd better go.

234
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,088
What happened to your face?

235
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,522
I hurt it playing baseball.

236
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,045
You hurt it playing baseball?

237
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,370
Let's not buy from Uncle Fat
on credit anymore.

238
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,083
He's been real mean lately.
I have no idea why.

239
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,402
He's jealous of you
going to the university.

240
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,086
His daughter failed
the exam again this year.

241
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,681
That music
from the fruit stand again!

242
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,888
It's louder every day.

243
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,888
Eight years of war
with the Japanese.

244
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,721
Now we live in a Japanese house
and listen to Japanese music.

245
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,930
Don't forget we're invited
to Wang's for dinner Sunday.

246
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,931
Do I have to go?
Won't it be all grown-ups?

247
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,249
- Why'd you eat so little?
- There'll be lots of children.

248
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,362
I'm full.

249
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,361
Shall we bring a present?

250
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,968
Sure.

251
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,885
“The score with Sly
will be settled by this day.”

252
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,729
<i>Here, 70 bucks.</i>

253
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,401
All right!
Where'd you get it?

254
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,171
Don't ask too many questions.

255
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,485
<i>Kennedy's experience
in foreign affairs</i>

256
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,927
<i>is very limited.</i>

257
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,044
<i>Faced with the world's
communist community,</i>

258
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,801
<i>the American public
won't entrust the presidency</i>

259
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,691
<i>to a young,
inexperienced fellow like him.</i>

260
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,890
<i>Thomas, get in the back.</i>

261
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,283
<i>Little girl,
stand behind your mother.</i>

262
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,885
Wan-wan, don't hide in back.
You're always so shy.

263
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,365
<i>Wang, you have us over every time
you return from an official trip.</i>

264
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,610
“Official trip”!
I go for the fun of it.

265
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,050
America's incredible.
The skyscrapers -

266
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,282
<i>- Are you kidding?
- Absolutely not!</i>

267
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,687
They've got skyscrapers,
and Disneyland!

268
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,043
Mickey Mouse.
A great place for kids.

269
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,209
They gave me a tour
of an atomic bomb factory.

270
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,089
If I were an expert,

271
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,567
I'd have learned to make
my own A-bomb.

272
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,644
Then I could blow
the Communists to hell.

273
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,048
<i>Okay, time for the picture.</i>

274
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,728
<i>Everyone look this way.</i>

275
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,564
Don't say anything
until it's officially announced.

276
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,929
Thank you.

277
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,243
This is a nice surprise.

278
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,127
Don't mention it.
We're such old friends.

279
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,803
But there's something
I must remind you of.

280
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,771
It's been 12 years

281
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,401
since we came here
from Shanghai.

282
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,207
It's unlikely
we'll ever make it back.

283
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,887
While there's still time,

284
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,243
we should make
some long-term plans.

285
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,164
Your old Shanghai
intellectual mentality -

286
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,322
get rid of it.

287
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,562
Watch your temper.

288
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,650
You have to learn to be flexible.

289
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,362
On the surface,

290
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,689
I'm helping you
get this promotion.

291
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,088
Actually, you'll be helping me
in the future.

292
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,130
We're classmates.
Old friends.

293
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,810
Like in a gang.

294
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,849
Understand?

295
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,842
Getting Si'r transferred
back to day school

296
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,648
is no problem
with my current connections.

297
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,130
Thanks.

298
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,086
The night school's awful.

299
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,648
I worry about him turning bad.

300
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,845
What are you doing?

301
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,883
Get lost.

302
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,447
- You picked a good spot to watch.
- What?

303
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,841
Out of the way!

304
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,242
Mom, I'm bored.
Let's go home.

305
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,568
Soon, soon.

306
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,762
It's still like new.

307
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,403
I almost never use it.

308
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,882
I rarely have the occasion
to wear such a nice watch.

309
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,849
How time flies.

310
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,564
When I gave you that watch...

311
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,404
Why did you mention Professor Hsia
in front of Mrs. Hsia?

312
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,124
I didn't.

313
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,641
She saw my watch.

314
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,571
Why did Professor Hsia
go back to Shanghai alone?

315
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,003
Bringing more relatives over
must have been an excuse.

316
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,169
Mrs. Hsia's lived
like a widow ever since.

317
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,848
What was Wang
talking to you about?

318
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,207
Oh, nothing.

319
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,766
He can help get Si'r
transferred to day school.

320
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,042
There shouldn't be any problem.

321
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,601
What about
my teaching certificate?

322
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,409
You don't seem too concerned
about my problems.

323
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,371
Luckily my letter of employment
came early this year.

324
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,290
Every year I go
through the same stress.

325
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,602
You know what I mean.

326
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,802
Whose fault is that?

327
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,371
I told you to bring your official papers
when we left Shanghai.

328
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,206
I did. I put them
in the candy tin that we brought.

329
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,805
Don't read on the bus.
You'll ruin your eyes.

330
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,767
Those night classes
must be hurting Si'r's eyes.

331
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,686
They claim the free shots
at school will help.

332
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,646
I hope it will save us
from having to buy him glasses.

333
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,247
He has a secret to tell you.

334
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,686
What secret?

335
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,605
Tell her.
She'll give you a freebie.

336
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,640
I come here often
because you're so pretty.

337
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,571
<i>I'll</i> take this.
- You have to pay! Give it back!

338
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,480
- I have no money.
- Then give it back.

339
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,011
No.

340
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,844
No?

341
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,845
Don't unwrap it!

342
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,002
Don't you unwrap it!

343
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,488
Give it back!

344
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,443
They're red!

345
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,688
- You owe me 10 bucks!
- No, one!

346
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,208
Tiger, you're cheating!

347
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,043
<i>Don't touch that!</i>

348
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,561
One at a time.
Don't you know how to line up?

349
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,404
Wang Chun-ming.

350
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,686
Four times a day.
Come back if it doesn't help.

351
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,608
A stomachache?

352
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,643
You're sure?

353
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,888
You're not trying to fool me?
- No.

354
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,810
You can't get sent home
that easily.

355
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,167
Come to my clinic tomorrow
for another treatment.

356
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,484
Miss Ling.

357
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,731
Can you walk by yourself?
- I think so.

358
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,769
Give it a try.

359
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,611
Let's do this. You there.

360
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,767
Please help her back
to her classroom.

361
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,281
It's okay.
I can walk by myself.

362
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,571
It's okay.
I can walk by myself.

363
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,126
You can go back to class.

364
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,730
I'm fine.

365
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,608
Our military adviser.

366
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,523
- A pack of New Paradise.
- Three fifty.

367
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,404
- You're new here.
- That's right.

368
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,926
- Where are you from?
- Taichung.

369
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,361
He caught me cutting class once.

370
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,410
I used to live near Taichung,
at the CCK air base.

371
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,525
It reminds me of Wuhan,
on the mainland.

372
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,843
We can't stay here forever.

373
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,204
<i>You can't keep me
waiting here forever.</i>

374
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,808
<i>The boss is taking me
to Hong Kong next month.</i>

375
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,888
<i>You want anything
from Hong Kong?</i>

376
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,681
<i>Let me think about it.
I 'II tell you tonight.</i>

377
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,882
<i>Time for makeup.</i>

378
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,603
<i>Oh, I can't make it
tomorrow evening.</i>

379
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,041
<i>Field Marshal Wong
is taking me to dinner.</i>

380
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,925
<i>We made the date yesterday...
uh, last month.</i>

381
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,730
<i>If you want to quit, tell the boss
and save us both the trouble!</i>

382
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,009
<i>I didn't say that.
Stop looking for excuses.</i>

383
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,690
Me look for excuses?

384
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,610
You're the one
looking for excuses!

385
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,961
Me look for excuses?

386
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,245
And why all the heavy makeup?
It doesn't show my finest features.

387
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,044
What features?

388
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,369
Besides the boss liking you,
what else have you got?

389
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,562
There's no talking to you!

390
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,288
Did I say anything
about your script?

391
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,448
Where'd you copy it from?

392
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,206
I'm telling the boss.
To hell with you!

393
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,089
Get the hell out!

394
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,607
Who's the director here,
you or me?

395
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,121
Bitching about too much makeup!

396
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,248
What the hell!

397
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,922
Look in the mirror!

398
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,602
That face needs
all the makeup it can get!

399
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,283
Young lady.

400
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,809
What grade are you in?

401
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,410
Eighth.

402
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,564
<i>Assistant!</i>

403
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,808
This young girl isn't bad.
What do you think?

404
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,728
Get her address.

405
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,411
The role calls for a teenager.

406
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,491
You're pushing 40,
and you have the nerve to bitch?

407
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,289
Would you be interested
in a screen test?

408
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,611
So you live by Little Park too?

409
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,326
Lots of my classmates
live there.

410
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,041
You gonna do the screen test?

411
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,450
My boyfriend will be angry
if he finds out.

412
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,688
You going back to class?

413
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,888
Where else can we go?

414
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,168
<i>How do you know about this place?</i>

415
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,362
<i>I used to live near here.</i>

416
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,527
<i>I don</i> 7 <i>see any houses.</i>

417
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,402
If I were a guy,
I'd love to be in the army.

418
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,724
Why are you guys
all afraid of the army?

419
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,728
We're afraid of that.

420
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,011
Oh, look. A couple.

421
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,842
Dating one of our girls, eh?

422
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,044
It'll cost you, you hear?

423
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,561
- Ignore him.
- Ignore me?

424
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,203
He wouldn't dare!

425
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,491
You hiding your watch or what?

426
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,170
I don't have one.

427
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,608
Aren't you the soft-spoken one!
Want me to search you?

428
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,844
Lousy pen.

429
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,610
Dating a girl
without the dough -

430
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,160
No, don't! Let's go!

431
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,085
Hurry! Let's go, Si?!

432
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,727
Get on.
I'll give you a ride.

433
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,327
It's out of your way.
There's a bus up ahead.

434
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,848
I'm heading for Little Park too!

435
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,167
Don't you want to win back
what you lost?

436
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,524
You've got some attitude!
<i>I'll</i> keep it myself.

437
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,531
Leave me alone!

438
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,769
Threads, where you been?

439
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,961
It's so dark in here.
How about turning on some lights?

440
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,087
You owe 2,140.

441
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,404
Wanna pay up now
or try to win it back?

442
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,247
Win it back, of course.

443
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,643
Crazy, how about letting him
have a shot?

444
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,447
That bookworm?

445
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,011
Wow, from Jianguo High!

446
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,202
Scared you'll lose?

447
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,965
Rack 'em up.

448
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,526
That's it.
Let him learn from experience.

449
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,928
Lao Er, let's do it.
- Wait a minute.

450
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,441
Lao Er? “Prick”?

451
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,126
Haven't you got one already?

452
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,044
This one's for you.

453
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,606
Don't let him bother you.

454
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,962
Baldy, this kid's called Prick.

455
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,920
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

456
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,128
Nothing?
You look like shit.

457
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,646
What have you been up to lately?

458
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,804
Not much.
Things have been tough.

459
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,889
Ihear
you're putting on a concert.

460
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,289
There's no money in that.
Not like your racket here.

461
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,486
Got something going
with those rock and roll boys again?

462
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,881
That's about all
they've got going.

463
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,805
Not those Little Park boys again!

464
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,922
Five ball, side pocket.

465
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,008
Seven ball, corner pocket.

466
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,121
Four ball, corner pocket.

467
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,280
What a fluke!
The kid's got all the luck!

468
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,801
Damn! Set 'em up.

469
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,002
Come on, set 'em up.

470
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,964
You guys are going easy on us.

471
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,648
Take your time.
We'll win it all back.

472
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,649
Keep your cool.

473
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,251
Take your time.
Take it easy.

474
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,324
Plenty of time.
Two hundred a game.

475
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,490
Interesting... interesting.

476
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,762
Didn't you ditch class to go home?

477
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,161
Yeah, but I didn't go home.

478
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,811
Come help me with this.

479
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,447
Who the fuck you take me for?

480
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,891
Stay the hell out of my business!

481
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,167
My old man's in charge
of the auditorium.

482
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,086
We share the profits
from the concert.

483
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,401
Why give Threads such a big cut?

484
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,604
- Threads is here to help!
- Help how?

485
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,610
He's taking advantage
of our gang.

486
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,244
Let me tell you something.

487
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,127
I'm gonna tell him
he can't use the hall.

488
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,931
The question is:
Would you stop singing?

489
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,566
What the fuck are you saying?

490
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,968
Let me go!

491
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,726
Let him go. it's cool.

492
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,681
Fuck you, man!

493
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,201
What the fuck are you saying?

494
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,927
Jade, it's none
of your business! Get out!

495
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,606
Let me go!

496
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,847
You've gone too far this time!

497
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,682
Motherfucker!

498
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,922
Don't go inside.

499
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,291
You started it.
- Me?

500
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,370
You said you saw Jade
with Sly that night.

501
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,448
Now the shit's hit the fan.

502
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,803
- I didn't say it was Jade.
- Who else would it be?

503
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,080
My precious little baby!

504
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,487
I'll swallow you up in one bite!

505
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,484
Blind Man's jealous
of you already.

506
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,249
If Honey were here,

507
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,931
none of this
would have happened.

508
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,122
Threads wouldn't dare
underestimate us.

509
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,244
Now both Deuce and Sly
want to be boss.

510
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,961
Cat, you're on!

511
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,243
Now what?

512
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,604
Why did you say
I was with Sly that night?

513
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,729
I didn't say it was you.
I couldn't see clearly.

514
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,404
Wasn't it you?

515
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,727
Yeah... it was.

516
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,602
Sorry! I didn't mean it!
I thought no one was home!

517
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,287
Little thief! If anything's stolen,
we'll come looking for you!

518
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,287
Where's Si'r?
- I guess he's out.

519
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,290
What are you doing here?

520
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,286
Ask your big sister to transcribe
some lyrics for me, okay?

521
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,404
Sis, can you help him?

522
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,043
Transcribing lyrics again?

523
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,960
You want to sing American songs
when you don't know a word of English!

524
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,930
Don't be mad.
I didn't look on purpose.

525
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,088
I didn't see anything.

526
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,080
But I gotta say
that dress looks great!

527
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,807
I don't have a lot of time.

528
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,403
She fell for it.

529
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,691
Your sweet talk worked again.

530
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,449
Sis, I forgot my lunch box.
Mom says to reheat it for me.

531
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,971
Where's Mom?

532
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,844
Supervising an exam.

533
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,687
Wow, a new dress!

534
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,089
That's strange.

535
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,648
Did you plug it in?

536
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,365
Yeah.

537
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,683
Damn it.

538
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,367
It's not working.

539
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,169
What now?

540
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,370
I know.
Bring me your radio.

541
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,368
Wow, you copied this one!

542
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,886
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Just fixing it.

543
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,044
- I'm going!
- Without your lunch?

544
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,171
Don't spend your pocket money
onjunkfood!

545
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,203
Make it last!

546
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,488
Will this work?

547
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,048
Nothing smaller?

548
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,527
Si'r, you boys want lunch?

549
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,730
- Not right now.
- I ate.

550
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,123
- Why isn't it working?
- It should be.

551
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,368
Sure you put it
back together right?

552
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,684
Don't be stupid.
I numbered everything.

553
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,364
You fucked it up.

554
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,608
Stay cool, man.

555
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,643
See?

556
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,411
Piece of shit.
I'll find you a new one.

557
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,528
Got any money?

558
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,081
When have I ever had money?

559
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,284
- And you?
- Trying to rip me off?

560
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,161
Come on.
Go inside and get some.

561
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,404
You see that?

562
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,200
What?

563
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,209
My old man's inside.

564
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,201
What a day, man.

565
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,409
Tiger.

566
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,640
What's the deal
with Ming's injured leg?

567
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,242
I heard it was from
playing basketball with you.

568
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,964
Come on.
Let's talk somewhere else.

569
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,367
Why can't we talk here?

570
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,324
If we talk here,

571
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,802
it won't look good for you.

572
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,046
Interesting.
Tell me what won't look good.

573
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,690
You should be clear
about whose girl Ming is.

574
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,810
- I am.
- Good.

575
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,800
If Honey found out,
he wouldn't be pleased.

576
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,249
My job is to make sure
he doesn't find out.

577
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,688
He won't find out.

578
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,169
He better not.

579
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,326
Keep that in mind.

580
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,403
Hey, I'm not done with you.

581
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,522
What's the big idea?

582
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,648
What are you doing?

583
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,762
This is between him and me.

584
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,326
You two are classmates.
Why all the fuss?

585
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,201
FUCK you!

586
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,648
- This is between him and me.
- And Ming!

587
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,001
Isn't he going out with Ming too?

588
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,930
Someone saw them
in a classroom that night.

589
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,441
Tell us what's wrong.

590
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,921
Tell us.
We want to know.

591
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,922
Go tell your Little Park gang.

592
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,686
I've known Honey for years.

593
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,241
I'll take all you sissies on
anytime!

594
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,727
Now get back to class.

595
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,765
Get back to class!

596
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,447
Mom, let me borrow
your earrings and watch.

597
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,366
Sure, but be extra careful
with the watch.

598
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,808
How come
there's only NT$800 left?

599
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,962
I paid our tab at Uncle Fat's

600
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,721
so he won't squawk
next time we buy on credit.

601
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,441
Wang got you a promotion

602
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,688
but not a raise in pay.

603
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,649
What's wrong?

604
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,329
Nothing.

605
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,007
What's with the radio?

606
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,809
What's going on?

607
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,447
I saw Si'r taking it apart
at lunchtime.

608
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,241
Damn it.

609
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,009
Stand up.

610
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,529
Where's your composition?

611
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,729
You're the only one
who didn't hand one in.

612
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,203
Excuse me.

613
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,729
This is Ma,
our new transfer student.

614
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,161
Let's welcome him.

615
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,602
As I was saying,

616
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,048
Chinese characters
reveal a great logic.

617
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,403
Foreign languages can't compare.

618
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,007
Twenty-six letters
mixed and matched - that's all.

619
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,521
Monotonous and tedious.

620
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,881
Take the character shan,
meaning “mountain.”

621
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,404
Spell it in English for me.

622
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,289
How tedious!

623
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,371
He's the guy who knifed someone
at Banqiao High.

624
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,569
Wang Mao, stand up.

625
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,689
You have something to add?

626
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,961
No.

627
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,811
Then what were you discussing?

628
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,961
Sir, what about “I”?

629
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,441
What do you mean,
what about you?

630
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,730
No, I mean from what you said,
what about the character for “I”?

631
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,361
Come up here.

632
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,449
Come up front.

633
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,123
You know
the character wo means "I".

634
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,282
- Yeah.
- Then write it.

635
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,681
You're fond of that word,
aren't you?

636
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,968
Write it a hundred times.

637
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,445
Go on!

638
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,006
You seem to enjoy it.

639
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,924
Keep writing!

640
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,526
That's two. Good.

641
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,210
Keep going.

642
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,802
Who's hissing?

643
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,041
Zhang Zhen, stand up.

644
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,522
Who hissed at me?
Speak up.

645
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,644
I don't know.

646
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,127
Then who were you looking at?

647
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,766
Who was it?

648
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,009
I didn't see anyone.

649
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,685
Fine.

650
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,047
If you won't say, it was you.

651
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,282
Stay standing.

652
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,802
Let's turn to page 33.

653
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,004
<i>Xiao Si'r!</i>

654
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,563
Xiao Si'r!

655
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,408
- You got any porn?
- Yes.

656
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,090
Xiao Si'r!

657
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,803
- Didn't you hear me calling?
- No.

658
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,487
The screen test is tomorrow.
Wanna come?

659
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,250
Sure.

660
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,604
What's wrong?

661
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,091
Nothing.

662
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,089
You seemed scared to see me.

663
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,090
You afraid
we'll be seen together?

664
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,966
Whoa, out on a date, huh?

665
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,607
Come on.
Let's not talk here.

666
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,090
- Let me have that porn.
- Here.

667
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,490
I thought your boyfriend wouldn't like it
if you took the screen test.

668
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,931
Is that why you're afraid
of being seen with me?

669
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,487
I just don't want any trouble.

670
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,325
I know Honey is your boyfriend.

671
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,160
You still won't admit
you're afraid of me?

672
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,722
You're funny.

673
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,010
What are you laughing at?

674
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,165
You're so honorable.
It'll get you in trouble.

675
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,324
Why?

676
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,569
Honey's like you.

677
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,047
Everyone's scared of him,

678
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,090
but they don't realize
he's straight as an arrow.

679
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,522
He can't stand things
that are unfair.

680
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:30,366
He takes it on himself
to straighten things out.

681
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,287
I tried to convince him

682
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,802
that he can't change
the world by himself.

683
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,961
He'd argue with me

684
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,840
and blame me
for discouraging him.

685
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,728
But now that he's gone,

686
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,447
I miss him so much.

687
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,649
I just cry and Cry-

688
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,444
I heard it was because of you

689
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,610
that Honey killed Redhead,
the former 217 boss,

690
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,722
and then went on the run.

691
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,684
Is that true?

692
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,966
Will you come watch
my screen test tomorrow?

693
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,651
If I come, <i>I'll</i> be up there.

694
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,808
You gonna do it?

695
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:11,010
<i>There is a place
of peace and calm</i>

696
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,887
Are you sure your weekly
Bible class and choir

697
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,367
won't affect
your grades at school?

698
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,568
Did you have a good time?

699
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,564
Careful!

700
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:45,044
Your father and I met
at a dance back in Shanghai.

701
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:49,529
We girls at the Teachers College
were very westernized.

702
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,967
Who'd have dreamed
I'd meet this peasant boy?

703
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:01,168
He'd just arrived in Shanghai
from Guangzhou.

704
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,846
Luckily Wang took him around
and showed him the real world.

705
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,841
He was a real peasant boy.

706
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,927
Lots of girls liked him,
and he didn't even know it.

707
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,126
I thought he was real special.

708
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,570
<i>Sh.</i>

709
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,764
Come with me.

710
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,890
What's the matter?

711
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,369
- Where's the watch?
- What watch?

712
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,131
Mom's watch.
Did Cat steal it?

713
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,208
Impossible!

714
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,088
I had it at lunchtime,
but tonight it was gone.

715
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,402
Wasn't he here this afternoon?

716
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,045
I took it.

717
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,243
What?
What got into you? Why?

718
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,449
I owe someone money.

719
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,483
Owe someone money?

720
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,161
How much?
- Four hundred.

721
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,887
You pawned it, didn't you?

722
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,207
I swear,
you'll be the end of me!

723
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,931
Mom will skin you alive
if she finds out!

724
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,089
How come you owed so much?

725
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,284
Threads took me to shoot pool
with the Village boys.

726
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,283
We lost big.

727
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,727
Now he's messing
with the Little Park boys.

728
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,969
I gotta get out clean
before all hell breaks loose.

729
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,402
Mom never wears
the watch anyway.

730
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,925
Here.

731
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,284
Go get the watch back.

732
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,845
<i>I'll</i> say I sent you
for some language books.

733
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,201
Be sure you bring one back.

734
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,001
Mrs. Fang!

735
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,846
Has she had asthma long?

736
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,527
She's had attacks before,
but never this serious.

737
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,968
Most asthma medication
is no longer effective on her.

738
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,527
She must be especially careful
when the weather changes.

739
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,887
Don't let her be
in unventilated places

740
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,769
or get too tired.

741
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,882
Isn't this your address?

742
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,008
They live with me.

743
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,690
It's that much?

744
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,768
Couldn't you give me
a little discount?

745
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,051
Her daughter said she knows you.

746
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,924
That's why I brought her here.

747
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,482
You've treated
her daughter before, right?

748
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,769
Well... yes.

749
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:44,010
But I can't make
decisions like this.

750
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,411
<i>Are you thinking
about something sad?</i>

751
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,482
<i>Can you tell me about it?</i>

752
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:02,289
<i>Maybe you don't know
where to start.</i>

753
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,848
<i>Can you tel! me now?</i>

754
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,844
<i>Okay.</i>

755
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,285
<i>Not bad. Very good.</i>

756
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,241
What now, sir?

757
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,284
Let's try a historical costume.

758
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,363
Are you sure?

759
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,129
All right.

760
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,886
Sir, the boss lady's here!

761
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,044
What's this I hear
about my leading lady?

762
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,807
The part calls for a teenager,

763
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,321
so we got a teenager.

764
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,807
Can you guarantee
the box office?

765
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:12,881
Well, times are hard...

766
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,690
It's very obvious.

767
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,689
You two made
the exact same mistakes.

768
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,650
I didn't <i>lei</i> him copy.
He just did.

769
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:23,481
Who are you trying to fool?
The exact same mistakes.

770
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,921
Not one word more
or one word less.

771
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,168
Demerits for both of you.

772
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:31,529
I made mistakes on purpose,
and he copied them.

773
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,404
You still dare to talk back?

774
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,403
I didn't do anything wrong.

775
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,682
You speak
to a teacher like that?

776
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,569
I didn't do anything wrong.

777
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,127
Keep talking back.
It'll get you another demerit!

778
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,486
Why?

779
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:48,730
Who's talking back
to a teacher like that?

780
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,322
You two again!

781
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,331
<i>We have our regulations.
My hands are tied.</i>

782
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,888
Try this new tea for a change.

783
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,008
He was obviously a victim,

784
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,283
and you're punishing him
without an investigation.

785
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,562
This isn't fair!

786
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,408
I send my son to you,

787
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,370
hoping he'll become
a decent, honest person.

788
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,690
If he makes mistakes,
I hope you'll correct him.

789
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,087
But when you act like this -

790
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,726
it's just not fair!

791
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,201
What is this? Lao Fan!

792
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,571
What the hell is this?
- What's the matter?

793
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,529
None of your business.

794
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,850
Your son's lucky.
The other boy's been expelled.

795
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:52,363
Because of all his demerits!
That's irrelevant!

796
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,768
You think your son
is a model student?

797
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,082
I've nabbed him myself
many times.

798
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,242
That has nothing
to do with this!

799
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,085
This isn't education!
You harass the good students!

800
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,571
Don't get excited.

801
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,763
We have our regulations.
There's no way I can help.

802
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,531
I'm not here for your help.
I'm here for justice.

803
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,282
I'm not looking for personal favors.
I don't need your help.

804
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,291
How can you have
such a bureaucratic attitude?

805
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,762
I can't believe it!

806
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,123
It's my fault.

807
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,323
I lost my cool.

808
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,727
It's a bad habit of mine.

809
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,800
I can't help it.
When I see these bureaucrats -

810
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,049
He deserved it.

811
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,722
But you really surprised me.

812
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,286
That's not what
you should be learning.

813
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,888
You might as well
take the demerit.

814
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,361
A person who'll apologize

815
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,801
for wrongs he didn't commit

816
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,164
is capable of all sorts
of terrible things.

817
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:05,564
But that kind of thing
seems to happen so often.

818
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,525
Exactly.

819
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,088
The purpose of education
is to search for the truth of life

820
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,123
to believe in.

821
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,688
If you can't be brave enough
to believe in it,

822
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,882
then what's the purpose of life?

823
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,923
Si'r, you're lucky.

824
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,042
I hope this incident

825
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:32,926
proves to be something positive
and not a setback.

826
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,246
You must believe that your future

827
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,886
is determined
by your own hard work.

828
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,648
You still unhappy?

829
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,488
About me getting you
this demerit?

830
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,730
No, I'm worried
about what Mom will think.

831
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,763
I'm worried for your sake.

832
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,011
Your poor mother.

833
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:04,085
All these years,
and she still worries about me.

834
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,809
Remember:

835
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,961
Things with a hole in the middle
bring headaches.

836
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,643
What's that mean?

837
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:18,528
Nothing. You'll find out
when you grow up.

838
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,562
What are you studying?

839
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,528
I'm studying at a cram school.

840
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,405
No, I mean the book.
It's so thick.

841
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,006
We all know
that your daughter goes

842
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,327
to the best college.

843
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,764
I didn't mean that.

844
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,769
<i>Yeah, I'll bet.</i>

845
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,362
But who cares where she goes?

846
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,411
My daughter doesn't go
running around with boys

847
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,489
and holding their hands.

848
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,089
Now, wait a second.

849
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,487
We're all neighbors.
Why that tone?

850
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,604
Exactly. I'm saying
this for your own good.

851
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,649
Don't get me wrong.

852
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,206
Kids nowadays
aren't what you think,

853
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,529
with their dating
and their street gangs.

854
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,449
Take him, for example,
at night school and all.

855
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,291
He must be tough to handle.

856
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,122
So a good school
isn't everything, is it?

857
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,762
Find something better to do
with your time!

858
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:31,091
So I don't have
a cushy job like yours.

859
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,727
I worked for the railroads,
you know!

860
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,923
And I quit myself!
No one fired me!

861
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,481
If you had better things
to do with your salary,

862
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,802
you wouldn't turn it over to me!

863
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,281
Without my credit, you'd starve!

864
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,643
What's gotten into you, Father?

865
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,006
You want another heart attack?

866
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,164
- You've been drinking again.
- Mind your own business!

867
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,087
When people negotiate,
they defuse the issue.

868
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,283
You end up getting him
a major demerit!

869
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,761
<i>The demerit is beside the point.</i>

870
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,247
<i>He must learn
to be just and honorable.</i>

871
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,525
<i>This is the time
to insist on principles</i>

872
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,360
<i>and set a good example
for the children.</i>

873
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,841
This isn't the time for principles!

874
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,843
I'm going to the bathroom.

875
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,327
- You always mess things up.
- <i>Nonsense.</i>

876
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:27,642
<i>I've lived my life
at peace with myself.</i>

877
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,683
<i>I've never messed things up.</i>

878
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,330
What's your problem?
I was reading.

879
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,124
Gimme!

880
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,883
<i>Going out this late?</i>

881
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,691
I need to borrow
a book from a friend.

882
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,611
Hurry home,
and don't be running around!

883
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,721
Mrs. Fang was kind to us.

884
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,721
My asthma's done it again.

885
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,571
I can't blame her
for letting me go.

886
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,770
Ming...

887
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,763
hurry and grow up.

888
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,046
My future depends on you.

889
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,089
Finally.

890
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,048
You kept us all waiting.

891
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,650
Get inside.

892
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,811
Move!

893
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,526
What are you staring at?
You got a problem?

894
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,005
Move!

895
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,330
Hurry UP-

896
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:44,402
It's okay.
They want you inside.

897
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,526
Come on in, Lao Er.

898
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,689
Take the bike for him.

899
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:16,162
<i>You can't blame
Mrs. Fang for this.</i>

900
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,681
<i>You know my asthma condition.</i>

901
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,087
<i>Who knows when it'll act up?</i>

902
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:26,801
<i>Why make a big thing
about us moving back?</i>

903
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,922
Things are different now.

904
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,208
Look at all these mouths
I have to feed.

905
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,686
<i>You're the only relative we have.</i>

906
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,241
Where else can we go?

907
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,966
You brought us to Taiwan
with your regiment.

908
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:46,163
If you don't want us,
send us away.

909
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,123
Why all the fuss?

910
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:52,050
I always move out
the minute I find work.

911
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,930
This place belongs to the army.

912
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,242
You're a freeloader here too.

913
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,284
A freeloader?

914
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,805
At her age, I was fighting
the Japs and the Commies!

915
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,970
Let me tell you:
I <i>am</i> this country.

916
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,441
This place belongs to the army,
so it's mine.

917
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,210
What a joke!

918
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,206
So we'll say you owe 350 of it.

919
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,527
I'm not responsible for it.

920
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,531
You're not? He says
he's not responsible for it.

921
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,802
What do you take us for?

922
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,486
I've been a little short
on cash recently.

923
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:39,408
Shandong,
you trust me, don't you?

924
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,809
Come this way. Do as I say.

925
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,247
Don't be a hothead like me.

926
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,721
Cool down a bit.

927
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,124
I heard...

928
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,571
your concert tickets
have been selling well.

929
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,644
Not at all.

930
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,491
Someone's trying to ruin it all.

931
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:17,007
Your concert
with the Little Park boys

932
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,691
has made us look bad.

933
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,404
You always share the goodies
with the other guys.

934
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,286
In this greasy little head of yours,

935
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,091
what are we really?

936
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,248
I'm gonna kick your ass

937
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,647
even if Shandong
lets you off easy.

938
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,330
Shit, the power again!

939
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,762
Threads, don't run off.
Stay where you are.

940
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,484
How could a jerk like Sly
have so much pull?

941
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,888
It's his old man who has
all the clout, not him.

942
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,207
What do you expect me to do?

943
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,963
I tell you what.

944
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:07,165
I'll give you a break
on the money you owe me.

945
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,288
Just do me one favor.

946
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,641
I want to meet with Sly.

947
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:29,647
Impossible! The two gangs
are bitter enemies.

948
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,961
<i>Wheres the Independent News?</i>

949
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,847
Orders from upstairs.
We only get the Central <i>Daily</i> now.

950
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:46,769
Going to the movies again?
What about school work?

951
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,682
Just play your game.

952
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:08,125
<i>The days drag
since you got expelled, huh?</i>

953
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:13,568
Shit.
What are you doing here?

954
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,129
I've becomes partners
with them in the concert.

955
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,723
Then I'm out.

956
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,567
Come on, don't be so rash.

957
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,286
Why let such a beautiful hall
sit vacant?

958
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,890
Look at it this way.

959
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,322
As long as the two of you
can work together,

960
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:40,490
there's no limit
to the bucks that'll roll in.

961
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,602
Think about it.

962
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:45,246
The whole 217 gang
will be behind you.

963
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:49,729
Who else will the Little Park boys
follow but you?

964
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,082
You want me
to betray my brothers.

965
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,844
Not a chance.

966
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,730
Make peace over a smoke.

967
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,605
Come on, have one.

968
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:05,564
Shit!
Now you're playing the Indian?

969
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,287
It seems you have...

970
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,122
woman problems.

971
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,329
Jade?

972
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,284
No problem there.

973
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,840
I'm not talking about Jade.

974
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,886
I've kept it under wraps...

975
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,004
or else we wouldn't
be here talking.

976
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,364
Right?

977
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,527
If you've got problems...

978
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,011
I can solve them for you.

979
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,563
Not that one.

980
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,850
The first song on side A.

981
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,122
Don't anyone move.

982
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,367
Which one of you is Tiger?

983
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,002
Won't show yourself, huh?

984
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:42,329
What a load of crap!

985
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:46,161
When can I get the lyrics?
- Depends on my big sister.

986
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,203
Tomorrow, okay?

987
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,884
- Still trying to hide?
- I'm not Tiger.

988
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,968
You're not, huh?

989
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,890
No!

990
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,406
It's not me!

991
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,287
Then who was the guy with Ming
at the shooting range?

992
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,724
Move it.

993
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,727
Did you get your kicks

994
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,845
fooling around
with one of our girls?

995
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,246
- Stand at attention!
- Attention!

996
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,569
Don't you know
how to stand at attention?

997
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,603
<i>Where are you boys from?</i>

998
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,929
Looking for trouble, fucker?

999
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,244
<i>You know whose turf you're on?</i>

1000
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,246
It's Ma, General Ma's son.

1001
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,927
Fuck you!
Where's your turf?

1002
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,128
Wherever I am is my turf.

1003
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,722
It was all a misunderstanding.

1004
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,844
Okay, then it's all settled.

1005
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,322
Let's get back to the village.

1006
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,206
Thanks.

1007
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:14,563
No problem.
Some of them recognized me.

1008
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,481
I thought you were
a model student,

1009
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,690
but you mess around with girls
and get into fights.

1010
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,411
They picked a fight with me.

1011
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,883
Getting in trouble over a girl
is just plain dumb.

1012
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,650
Understand?

1013
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,925
Where'd they go?

1014
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,280
It's over.

1015
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,402
What the hell's all this?

1016
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,409
We came to save you.

1017
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,806
You've actually used these
in fights? Shit!

1018
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,646
You wanna fight?
Take this.

1019
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,644
This is a real weapon.

1020
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,331
Holy smokes! Cool, man!

1021
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:58,722
Is this what you used
on that guy at Banqiao High?

1022
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,483
Where'd you get it?

1023
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,927
Right here, above the ceiling.

1024
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,328
A Japanese general
used to live here.

1025
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:12,166
Check your attic at home.
You might find something.

1026
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:15,523
I found a bullet
for a Japanese rifle once.

1027
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,806
Shit! What's this now?

1028
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,888
A tape recorder from when
Eisenhower came here.

1029
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,482
An American reporter left it
to my old man.

1030
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:31,328
It can record a barking dog
ten miles away.

1031
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,371
<i>What are you doing, Cat?</i>

1032
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,449
<i>Tearing the house apart?</i>

1033
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,961
I'm looking for rats.

1034
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,522
You've moved back again.

1035
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:42,605
They say every time you move,
you find a new boyfriend.

1036
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,685
How about me this time?

1037
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,687
Don't understand
what I'm saying?

1038
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,808
You understand that, don't you?

1039
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:37,125
You got some nerve,
moving back at a time like this.

1040
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,609
We'll probably all end up
in trouble because of you.

1041
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:01,561
Shit! Putting on
that “poor little me” look again?

1042
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,931
Any word from Honey?

1043
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:28,362
- Look who finally shows up!
- Did they call roll?

1044
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,528
No, it was a study period.

1045
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:32,802
What the hell's that?

1046
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,002
Cat's record player.

1047
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,363
Hey, can you get me
some tickets?

1048
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,848
For the concert?
Ask Cat.

1049
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,402
Neither he nor Airplane
showed up.

1050
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,688
<i>I'll</i> ask him for you.

1051
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,451
<i>- Where do you come from?
- Hualien.</i>

1052
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,166
<i>Hualien?
That's a nice place.</i>

1053
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,880
<i>I was stationed there
for a month.</i>

1054
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:03,208
<i>What made you come to Taipei?</i>

1055
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,527
<i>There's a lot more
happening here.</i>

1056
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:08,405
<i>You young people go
where the crowds are.</i>

1057
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,927
<i>It's true,
a lot's happening in Taipei,</i>

1058
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,203
<i>but nothing compared
to my hometown.</i>

1059
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,610
<i>Take my hometown, for example.</i>

1060
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,649
I come from Qingdao.

1061
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,008
Qingdao is -

1062
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,482
A shot for your eyes?

1063
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,843
I've run out. Try next week.

1064
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,922
The architecture in Qingdao
is very special.

1065
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:36,764
The Germans built it.

1066
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:39,161
The drainage system
is remarkable,

1067
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,442
with big wide canals.

1068
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,927
It doesn't matter
how hard it rains.

1069
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:47,129
Once it stops, there's never
any water on the ground.

1070
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,964
Not like Taipei.

1071
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,122
When it rains,
there's water everywhere.

1072
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,681
Didn't you say you'd come
to my screen test?

1073
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,088
Why didn't you show up?

1074
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,250
Didn't you hear
I got a major demerit?

1075
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:20,370
And remember when
some 217 guys saw you and me

1076
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,881
at the shooting range?

1077
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:26,488
They came after me
the other night at school.

1078
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,565
I've had a string
of bad luck lately.

1079
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:41,164
Cat told me to go
to the ice cream parlor.

1080
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,607
He seemed nervous,
like something was up.

1081
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,404
You saw Cat?

1082
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,524
No wonder he and Airplane
cut class today.

1083
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:52,442
<i>I'll</i> go with you.
I've got something for him.

1084
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:56,049
Aren't you afraid of getting
into trouble again?

1085
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:59,846
Nothing's going on between you and me.
What's to be afraid of?

1086
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,284
- What are you doing here?
- Returning this to you.

1087
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,562
The lyrics are inside.

1088
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,286
- What are you doing here?
- You own the place?

1089
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:31,284
It's cool, man.
He's here to see me.

1090
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:35,807
You're acting gutsier
than last time I saw you.

1091
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:40,805
I hear you two are having
a real sweet time lately.

1092
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,724
Who are you talking about?

1093
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,888
What an actor!

1094
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,931
A real Gregory Pecker!

1095
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,042
Now you're in deep shit.

1096
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:56,242
Don't run off.

1097
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,202
We're all brothers.
Forget it.

1098
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,968
Tough guy, eh?

1099
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,642
Where'd you learn it from?

1100
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,486
Fuck! I'm gonna
teach you a lesson.

1101
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,971
This doesn't hurt anymore, huh?

1102
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,481
<i>Just 'fishes, huh'?</i>

1103
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:23,131
Aren't you a model student?
How come you're getting angry?

1104
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,288
He's not.

1105
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,887
Want me to teach you
a lesson too?

1106
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,441
Picking on a squirt like that -

1107
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,568
pretty pathetic.

1108
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,849
Come with me.

1109
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:51,170
I was just taking care
of business for you.

1110
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:57,047
- You look like a good kid.
- I'm here to see Cat.

1111
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:02,367
You have no business here.

1112
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:06,889
Get going.

1113
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,651
You done talking?

1114
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,401
Most of the guys
feel the same way.

1115
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,326
Things can't go on
as they are now.

1116
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,369
Someone has to take charge.

1117
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,211
Things have to go on
when you're not here.

1118
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:47,530
Your problems with
the 217 boys are personal.

1119
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,369
They came for peace
on their own initiative.

1120
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:54,645
The guys all think
we should consider it.

1121
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,729
Think it over.

1122
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,321
Let us know
what you think next time.

1123
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,130
Shit!

1124
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,762
This is open mutiny.

1125
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,525
Brother.

1126
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,329
Things aren't
as simple as you think.

1127
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,451
Go tell Eastgate Ling
and Third-ring Ye

1128
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,329
that I'm in town.

1129
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:30,283
Tell them to come over.

1130
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,968
Don't say anything else.

1131
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,645
Shit.

1132
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:47,481
Shandong and Threads have turned
the concert into quite an affair.

1133
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,807
Let's add a little heat.

1134
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,765
Does it have to be
during the concert?

1135
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:00,522
Shit! No wonder you'll never be
a match for Sly.

1136
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:04,769
All you worry about is
getting on stage and singing.

1137
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,129
Am I right?

1138
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,249
You're hopeless.

1139
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,451
- Didn't you say Lao Er knows?
- About what?

1140
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:47,404
What Threads
and the 217s are up to.

1141
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,602
Lao Er.

1142
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,451
Get up.

1143
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:57,481
This is no time for talking.
Let's kill 'em!

1144
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:00,604
Fuck! Why look for help
from Eastgate and Third-ring?

1145
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:03,121
I've got enough guys
to do the job.

1146
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:05,607
- What?
- Matches.

1147
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,249
Shit, let's kill 'em!

1148
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:15,487
How'd you get mixed up
with Threads?

1149
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:19,969
I met him in a pool hall
near school

1150
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:23,329
He said he knew
a way to make money.

1151
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,966
The money sounded good, so -

1152
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,845
I was only down south
a few months

1153
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:32,123
before you guys here
started itching to make money.

1154
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,926
Is life in Taipei really that hard?

1155
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:39,604
Sly used to beg me

1156
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,367
to take him into our gang.

1157
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:46,167
If it weren't for you saying

1158
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:51,123
his old man could let you use
the auditorium for your concerts,

1159
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:54,369
I wouldn't give a shit
about that asshole.

1160
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,444
Now that the 217 gang
is behind him,

1161
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,847
he's showing his true colors.

1162
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,002
All for a few bucks.

1163
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:10,162
He's the boss of Little Park now,

1164
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:12,409
understand?

1165
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:17,371
Go tell Eastgate's
and Third-ring's boys

1166
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,807
that we've decided
not to crash the concert.

1167
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:23,011
Since both Shandong
and Threads know I'm back,

1168
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,367
they'll take precautions.

1169
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:29,207
I'll settle this score
some other time.

1170
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,964
All right.

1171
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,609
You going back
to Doggie's in Tainan?

1172
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:43,286
You're welcome
to hide out here with us.

1173
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:45,848
I'm going back to Tainan.

1174
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:48,930
There's no future in hanging out
with these mainland kids.

1175
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:52,010
I can speak Taiwanese
like you locals now.

1176
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:54,600
I was like a mute in Tainan

1177
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:58,884
not speaking the native language.
Thanks for all the hospitality.

1178
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,561
Don't mention it.

1179
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:04,923
A friend of Doggie's
is a friend of mine.

1180
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,163
Deuce.

1181
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,407
Go ahead and sing
at the concert.

1182
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,251
It's no big deal.
Don't sweat it.

1183
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:19,410
Relax and put on a good show.

1184
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,250
You there.

1185
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,250
Come over here.

1186
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:54,808
Ming tells me
she likes you a lot.

1187
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:01,288
I could tell right away
when I first met you.

1188
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:09,724
Ming's been waiting
for you to get back.

1189
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:19,089
When I got bored
while I was hiding out,

1190
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:23,362
I'd read tons
of martial arts novels a day.

1191
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:29,007
I'd tell them to get me
the thickest novels they could find.

1192
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,608
I discovered people in the past

1193
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:38,162
who were just like us street gangs.

1194
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:43,322
There was this one guy.

1195
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:46,970
Everyone thought he was crazy.

1196
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,125
I remember...

1197
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,650
everyone had run away...

1198
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,001
and the city was set ablaze.

1199
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,410
He alone stayed behind
to assassinate Napoleon.

1200
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:06,523
In the end,
he failed and was caught.

1201
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,205
<i>War and Peace.</i>

1202
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:16,123
I've forgotten the names
of all the other novels.

1203
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:18,686
That's the only one I remember.

1204
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:23,128
Any problems?

1205
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:26,080
No. Come and sit.

1206
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:37,007
This is Horsecart.
Your name is...?

1207
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,407
Xiao Si'r.

1208
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:43,560
Ming will stay here a few days.

1209
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:47,043
They know I'm in Taipei.
They'll put a tail on her.

1210
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,971
She'll be very uncomfortable.

1211
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:57,522
You know,
if you'd written back...

1212
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,641
none of this
would have happened.

1213
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:02,610
Shit!

1214
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:05,929
If I could write,
I'd have written a novel!

1215
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:08,924
For people like me
to read in the future.

1216
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,683
It's too late now.

1217
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,882
I didn't study hard enough.

1218
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:54,441
Si'r, Sly's over there.

1219
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,886
Just look at him. Shit!

1220
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:03,602
Sly, let me introduce you
to a big shot.

1221
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:06,725
Don't tag along everywhere!

1222
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:11,600
Officer, this is the one
I told you about.

1223
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:14,644
He's the manager's son.

1224
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,044
What is it?

1225
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:41,251
Who you tryin' to scare
with these cops from Juvenile?

1226
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,921
I knew you were taking
precautions,

1227
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:49,367
so I took my own.

1228
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:54,366
You want to be responsible
if something happens?

1229
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,363
Students.

1230
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:14,451
We of course endorse

1231
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:17,803
extracurricular activities like this.

1232
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:21,442
But we must exercise restraint
as we have fun.

1233
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:25,043
Trouble will only spoil it
for everyone.

1234
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:27,769
Is that clear?

1235
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:30,121
Yes, sir!

1236
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:06,562
It's the national anthem!

1237
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,567
Stand at attention, all of you!

1238
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:49,849
Where's your ticket?

1239
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,728
Who let you put on this concert?

1240
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,321
You don't even consult me,

1241
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:58,125
then you dare ask me
for a ticket?

1242
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,767
Don't smoke when I'm talking!

1243
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:13,603
Come on. I've been
through this number before.

1244
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:18,928
Come on. I'll take you on.

1245
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,643
Where's your boss?
Tell Shandong to come out.

1246
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:12,203
<i>I'll</i> be right back.

1247
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:23,882
Get your ass over here!

1248
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:37,368
Distinguished guest...

1249
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:39,767
please come in
and enjoy the music.

1250
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:43,767
You're too kind.
I hear you want an agreement.

1251
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,445
Here I am.

1252
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:48,006
If you want an agreement,
talk to me first.

1253
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:51,485
Hey, it's a happy day.

1254
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:54,451
Let's talk things over
some other time.

1255
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,201
There's nothing happy
between you and me.

1256
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,967
If you've got the balls,
play for the money.

1257
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:03,890
Who said you could have
this concert on my turf?

1258
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,048
Fine. Come on and play.

1259
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:09,283
Juvenile Division's inside.
Let's see you play now.

1260
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,564
Think you're tough
'cause you outnumber me?

1261
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,246
Come on.
All together now.

1262
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:27,569
Or one at a time?

1263
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:30,083
Let him go.

1264
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,808
- Motherfucker!
- Hold it!

1265
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:48,449
Let's talk out there.

1266
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:53,562
This is how you 217 boys
always operate.

1267
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:57,321
The Navy of the Republic! Shit!

1268
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,050
I know that trick.

1269
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:02,528
Chickenshits like him
put on uniforms to fool the cops.

1270
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:05,723
<i>I'll</i> turn you in to the navy!

1271
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:07,609
Autograph!

1272
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:10,491
Sorry, folks!
This way, please.

1273
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:18,650
You looking for someone?
No one's allowed backstage.

1274
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:21,525
Just for a minute.
What'll it hurt?

1275
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:24,843
Who the hell are you?
You're not on staff.

1276
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,922
You really wanna know?

1277
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:36,845
Okay, I'll give 'em a message.

1278
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:39,202
It's private business.
No messages.

1279
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:43,930
Cool it. Tell us who you want
and we'll send for him.

1280
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,721
Airplane from Little Park.

1281
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:03,721
So you get by because
you have lots of people, huh?

1282
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:08,050
If you want to gang up on me
and kick my ass, fine.

1283
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:13,569
This is between you and me.
Let's go over there.

1284
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,248
I'm okay. Let him go!

1285
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:25,369
That was for setting up
the concert behind my back.

1286
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:28,325
Okay, let's start talking.

1287
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:33,006
This is a peace talk.
You're all witnesses.

1288
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,529
Come on.

1289
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:51,004
Only two types of people
scare me, Shandong:

1290
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:53,401
the type
that's not afraid to die,

1291
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,604
and the type that has no shame.

1292
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:59,409
Which type are you?

1293
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:03,965
Not talking?

1294
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:06,521
Don't wanna talk,
or afraid to talk?

1295
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:11,523
You don't seem the type
that's not afraid to die.

1296
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,283
I thought not.

1297
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:18,407
You look so dark and dreary.

1298
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:21,122
Don't be so unhappy.

1299
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,408
What's there to be afraid of?

1300
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:13,123
Put that away!
You lookin' for trouble?

1301
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:22,446
Can't find him.

1302
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,210
FUCK you!

1303
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,607
Don't give me that shit.

1304
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:30,523
Don't let me catch you alone.

1305
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,847
What are you doing out here?

1306
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,883
Get back inside.

1307
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:31,090
Next time let me sing
an Elvis song, okay?

1308
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,601
Shit! You singing Elvis!

1309
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,888
Then <i>I'll</i> sing Connie Francis!

1310
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:37,929
Take a look in the mirror!

1311
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:40,806
You only pick
on your own people.

1312
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:42,445
I'll show you I can.

1313
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:44,728
Then start your own band.

1314
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,922
Fine. I understand.

1315
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:21,368
We doctors should show
a charitable spirit.

1316
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:33,727
I told my father
about the medical expenses.

1317
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,968
He understands
your financial situation.

1318
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:38,442
There's no need to worry.

1319
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,801
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1320
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:44,488
It appears her problem
is only partly physical.

1321
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:47,645
Let her rest here a few days.

1322
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,448
I'll take good care of her.

1323
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:03,645
They all say Honey
was killed by the 217s,

1324
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:08,205
but the newspapers say
it was a traffic accident.

1325
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,767
Some people say he's AWOL
from the military.

1326
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:13,848
Didn't he go back south?

1327
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,527
Stop nagging!
It's none of your business!

1328
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:22,210
Tell me. I made a bet
that the news was wrong.

1329
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:25,005
How could he go AWOL?

1330
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:30,162
Didn't you see it happen, Ma?

1331
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:33,449
None of your fucking business!
Quit shooting off your mouth!

1332
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:35,921
I'll beat the shit out of you.

1333
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,522
Let's go. Time for class.

1334
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:00,008
Already?

1335
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,968
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

1336
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:11,082
Why don't you go between classes?

1337
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:27,166
I've been looking for you for days.
You didn't come to class.

1338
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:30,729
Were you sick?

1339
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:39,443
I thought he went back south.

1340
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:44,961
Before leaving Taipei...

1341
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:50,445
he left me the address
of his hideout.

1342
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:56,160
I was planning to go see him.

1343
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:59,409
He even laughed at me...

1344
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:03,087
for being so worried.

1345
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:12,089
It was strange.

1346
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:17,411
For many days
while I lay sick in bed,

1347
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,091
I couldn't recall Honey's face.

1348
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:23,928
I was scared and confused.

1349
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,810
Ming, don't be afraid!
You have to be brave!

1350
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:05,327
I'm with you.
You needn't be afraid!

1351
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:08,802
<i>I'll</i> always be with you!
<i>I'll</i> be your friend forever!

1352
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:11,004
I'll protect you.

1353
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,890
I don't need anyone's help.
No one can help anyway.

1354
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:47,127
Hey, it's Ming! By herself.

1355
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:50,449
- You got ideas?
- Shit! I wouldn't dare.

1356
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,169
Hey, look.

1357
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:02,088
Still blame me
for your leg injury?

1358
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:05,649
- Wasn't Tiger going out with her?
- She's not talking to him.

1359
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:07,444
Here he comes.

1360
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:21,807
Weren't you going out with her?

1361
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:26,128
Honey's dead.

1362
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:28,443
Now she's anyone's game...

1363
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:31,531
but I don't think
you stand much of a chance.

1364
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:34,962
Honey's no problem,
dead or alive.

1365
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:39,450
The idiot acted like
an arrogant prick at the concert.

1366
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:44,285
He wasn't hit by no car.
The 217 boys let him have it.

1367
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:47,602
You got something to say?

1368
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:50,204
Goddamn it!

1369
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:15,201
Hurry up
or I'll miss the last bus.

1370
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:18,046
Take it easy.
I'll give you a ride.

1371
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:21,403
Think <i>I'll</i> fall for that again?

1372
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:50,524
<i>Try Ihro wing I!
At me again, boy.</i>

1373
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:57,488
<i>Look at this guy.</i>

1374
02:04:58,120 --> 02:05:00,885
<i>Is he for real?</i>

1375
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,889
<i>I guess so.</i>

1376
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:26,644
Think it over.
Don't feel pressured.

1377
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:44,085
I've got to go. it's late.

1378
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:54,403
Getting Si'r transferred
to day school

1379
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:57,244
is complicated.

1380
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:59,761
I thought I could talk
my way through it

1381
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:02,526
so he wouldn't have to take
the transfer exams.

1382
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:05,564
<i>I'll</i> try my friends
on the Board of Education again.

1383
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:07,364
Thanks a lot.

1384
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:11,170
I'm still working
on your teaching certificate.

1385
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:13,487
It'll take some time.

1386
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:16,606
Good-bye.

1387
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:25,643
How could he ask me
for a favor like that?

1388
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:30,966
Try to just play along.

1389
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:33,287
Don't be too hardheaded.

1390
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:36,051
Don't let it get to you.

1391
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:40,008
Try not to make enemies.

1392
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:43,088
This isn't Shanghai,

1393
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:46,164
where you had
Professor Hsia to back you up.

1394
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:49,124
Being stubborn
won't make you any friends.

1395
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:52,007
This time
it's the new office furniture.

1396
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:54,800
Next time it'll be
the new building contract.

1397
02:06:55,320 --> 02:06:57,482
There'll be no end to it.

1398
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:59,887
Haven't you figured him out yet?

1399
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:02,162
You're the last person on his list.

1400
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:04,891
God knows
how many others are involved.

1401
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:07,044
What do you women know?

1402
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:10,767
He must have his own problems.
<i>I'll</i> try to talk to him.

1403
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:14,362
Are you crazy?
MING CAME TO SCHOOL TODAY, BUT...

1404
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:18,170
Why'd you have to take him on?

1405
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:21,449
Let's go find him.
We'll try the basketball court.

1406
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:25,169
Shit! What's that?

1407
02:07:26,360 --> 02:07:30,888
- Follow me if you have the balls.
- It's suicide, man!

1408
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,209
Suicide? <i>I'll</i> show them!

1409
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:36,169
Take that!

1410
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:38,124
And that!

1411
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:41,202
It's useless.

1412
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:47,766
This knife is for girls.

1413
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,923
They'll laugh at you.

1414
02:07:53,720 --> 02:07:55,370
Where'd you get it?

1415
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:59,326
In the attic,
with all the rest of it.

1416
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:05,323
Cool it.
Stick to your tapes.

1417
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:14,961
I've got an idea.
Let's get Ma's help.

1418
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:17,327
Si'r, you guys are close.

1419
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:20,568
Why ask other people for favors?

1420
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:23,087
We gotta get revenge, damn it!

1421
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:25,885
At least borrow
his samurai sword.

1422
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:31,129
What's up?

1423
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:33,402
That's what I want to know.

1424
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:39,046
Cat said you wanted me.

1425
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:40,765
No, I didn't.

1426
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:52,567
Why the long face?

1427
02:08:52,680 --> 02:08:54,603
Is it a girl?

1428
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:56,845
No.

1429
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:59,649
I told you it wasn't that.

1430
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:04,881
Getting worked up
over some chick looks bad.

1431
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,490
Understand?

1432
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:11,009
Look what happened to Honey.

1433
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:14,609
Everyone on the street
was scared of him.

1434
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:18,568
Then, all because
of some chick, he ends up -

1435
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:21,802
Is it Tiger?

1436
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:23,651
No.

1437
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:25,929
That's good.

1438
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:39,651
Load it.

1439
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:43,409
Now hold on tight and aim up.

1440
02:09:46,160 --> 02:09:47,924
Go on.

1441
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:51,964
Feels great, huh?

1442
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:54,847
Unload and put in a new one.

1443
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:48,288
Go over there, man.

1444
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:16,005
Shit, I'm showing you
a good time!

1445
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:18,129
Well?

1446
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:20,083
Did you get a kiss out of her?

1447
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:23,281
All this and not even a kiss?

1448
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:25,728
She wouldn't let you?

1449
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:31,244
Go on.

1450
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:34,047
Take Jade around back.

1451
02:14:34,760 --> 02:14:36,444
Hurry UP-

1452
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:39,964
She won't mind.

1453
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:42,962
Shit! What is this?

1454
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:45,965
I'm bending over backwards
for you, and you -

1455
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,684
Forget it.

1456
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:17,522
<i>Dumplings and buns!</i>

1457
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:35,567
Si'r, where are you going?

1458
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:38,847
Won't even answer!

1459
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:50,401
Little punk!
Watch where you're going!

1460
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:01,928
I love the night...

1461
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:13,964
She's always nagging!

1462
02:16:14,120 --> 02:16:16,088
I can't stand her nagging!

1463
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:24,041
Tough shit!

1464
02:16:58,040 --> 02:17:00,566
You again?
Working extra hours?

1465
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:02,091
Making some money?

1466
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:03,765
Every penny counts.

1467
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:06,685
Why make so much?
Saving it for a wife?

1468
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:10,407
Not one like yours.
You can't even drink at home.

1469
02:17:56,440 --> 02:17:59,683
What are you doing?
Don't act like a hooligan!

1470
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:05,364
Don't come near me!

1471
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:14,407
<i>Sergeant Chad!</i>

1472
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:18,321
- What is it?
- Come quick!

1473
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:25,811
Another heart attack.
Take it easy.

1474
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:31,161
You sure are heavy.

1475
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:43,050
I was afraid you'd have trouble
finding this place.

1476
02:18:43,880 --> 02:18:45,564
Xiao Si'r.

1477
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:48,160
Let's kill Mao Zedong!
Skin Zhou Enlai!

1478
02:18:48,280 --> 02:18:50,408
Let's take back the mainland!

1479
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:52,284
<i>Horsecart!</i>

1480
02:18:56,680 --> 02:18:59,490
How many vehicles you got?
- Plenty.

1481
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:01,369
You gotta be careful.

1482
02:19:02,720 --> 02:19:06,441
You trust the drivers?
- They're all our people.

1483
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:08,050
Good.

1484
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:13,007
Who's that kid?
- He's with me.

1485
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:18,161
<i>Why'd you turn it off?</i>

1486
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:19,885
I didn't.

1487
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:23,561
It took forever to tune.

1488
02:19:23,680 --> 02:19:26,843
Now I have to start all over.

1489
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:29,601
Why'd you use my comic books?

1490
02:19:29,720 --> 02:19:31,882
I looked all over for them.

1491
02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:34,845
You know how long
it takes to tune this?

1492
02:19:34,960 --> 02:19:37,247
<i>Go get it fixed, will you?</i>

1493
02:19:37,560 --> 02:19:40,450
LITTLE PARK ICE CREAM PARLOR

1494
02:19:43,600 --> 02:19:46,046
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1495
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:49,686
- Damn you, Blind Man!
- Goddamn it!

1496
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:52,449
Go to hell!

1497
02:19:56,640 --> 02:19:58,847
Selfish bastard!

1498
02:19:59,440 --> 02:20:01,283
You took advantage of me!

1499
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:03,966
Take your records with you!

1500
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:06,964
I don't want them!

1501
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:11,602
You'll be sorry when I'm dead!

1502
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:15,207
You no-good,
shameless bastard!

1503
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:18,085
Any woman
who touches you is cursed!

1504
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:23,280
Cheat! Asshole!
You're not a man!

1505
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:31,726
<i>You picked a great time
to join the gang -</i>

1506
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:33,968
<i>the night of a typhoon!</i>

1507
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:38,488
Even Baldy hasn't shown up.

1508
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:42,281
Ka Wu's gone to get him.
Why so jittery?

1509
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:48,329
Where you going?

1510
02:20:48,480 --> 02:20:50,005
To take a shit.

1511
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:51,650
Don't cut out on us.

1512
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:57,961
The typhoon's coming.
Why haven't you closed up?

1513
02:20:58,480 --> 02:21:01,450
Useless old motherfucker.
Go home and jerk off!

1514
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:04,849
FUCK you!

1515
02:21:46,360 --> 02:21:48,044
Relax.

1516
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:54,524
The power's out.

1517
02:21:56,320 --> 02:21:58,607
How come no one's around?

1518
02:23:03,320 --> 02:23:05,721
You two go watch the back door.

1519
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:20,728
What do we do about this guy?

1520
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:25,922
Can we go back now?

1521
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:57,682
Put that cleaver down!

1522
02:25:38,480 --> 02:25:40,323
You all right?

1523
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:42,124
Go after them!

1524
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:52,365
The initiation's starting
and you're home asleep!

1525
02:25:52,840 --> 02:25:55,605
- It was mahjong.
- Mahjong my ass!

1526
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:57,961
You still owe me from last time,
remember?

1527
02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:00,560
Let's play another game
afterwards.

1528
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:04,564
Ka Wu!

1529
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:09,522
Ka Wu!

1530
02:26:30,200 --> 02:26:35,240
Do you know
how lonely life can be?

1531
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:39,241
You know what it feels like

1532
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:42,887
in the depths of despair?

1533
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:47,683
Then go kill yourself!

1534
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:50,931
You're a fuckin' drag.

1535
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:57,851
No one respects me.

1536
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:03,091
What's the use of living?
I'm better off dead.

1537
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:07,291
Please let me borrow that.
Help me -

1538
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:10,365
Run!

1539
02:28:36,600 --> 02:28:38,602
Crazy...

1540
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:09,001
Did you kill Honey?

1541
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:21,364
<i>Shandong!</i>

1542
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:36,409
Crazy...

1543
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:38,890
Shandong!

1544
02:29:42,840 --> 02:29:44,604
Please get up!

1545
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:49,921
Come on, get up.

1546
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:10,609
Shandong!

1547
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:03,165
I could swear he sings
“...a brighter summer day.”

1548
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:07,287
But is that grammatically correct?

1549
02:31:27,640 --> 02:31:29,130
Mr. Zhang.

1550
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:31,250
What is it?

1551
02:31:58,600 --> 02:32:01,331
Could we do this tomorrow
during office hours?

1552
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:04,604
It's a rather unusual matter...

1553
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:07,724
All right.

1554
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:10,129
Let me get a jacket.

1555
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:21,202
Is it something Si'r did?

1556
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:36,880
<i>Residents in southwest Taiwan
should be prepared for floods.</i>

1557
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:41,445
<i>People on ships
in the vicinity of Taiwan</i>

1558
02:32:41,560 --> 02:32:43,961
<i>should also be on the alert...</i>

1559
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:02,849
You go to bed.
<i>I'll</i> wait up for Mom.

1560
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:16,451
Mom went to Mr. Wang's house.
She's been gone two hours.

1561
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,122
People came and took Dad away.

1562
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:21,925
I think they were
with the Secret Police.

1563
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:33,761
You're soaking wet!
- I forgot my raincoat.

1564
02:33:44,440 --> 02:33:47,284
You seem to lack inner calm.

1565
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:50,601
Don't give me your religion.

1566
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:55,443
<i>I've lived an honest life.</i>

1567
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:57,762
<i>I have nothing to hide.</i>

1568
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:01,291
<i>We have no doubt of that.</i>

1569
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:04,569
May I go, then?

1570
02:34:04,960 --> 02:34:06,962
I have to go to work.

1571
02:34:10,840 --> 02:34:13,127
You'd better rest a bit first.

1572
02:35:03,800 --> 02:35:07,646
Is this about
Professor Hsia again?

1573
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:10,446
We only touched
on one element last night.

1574
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:12,164
Here.

1575
02:35:13,440 --> 02:35:14,805
Relax.

1576
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:18,208
Write what you feel.
Don't hold back.

1577
02:35:20,080 --> 02:35:22,924
I studied music.
I'm an artistic type.

1578
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:25,924
You're really my superior
in that regard.

1579
02:35:26,840 --> 02:35:30,003
I really do understand
how educated people feel.

1580
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:34,284
Well, I'll leave you alone
for a while.

1581
02:35:36,240 --> 02:35:38,208
Oh, one other thing.

1582
02:35:38,320 --> 02:35:42,086
There's no actual sign,
but smoking's not allowed.

1583
02:35:42,200 --> 02:35:44,328
Sorry. It's the rules.

1584
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:46,723
But before -

1585
02:36:19,800 --> 02:36:23,771
<i>The blood and tears
I shed for you know no end</i>

1586
02:36:23,880 --> 02:36:27,601
<i>As I cast aside the red bean
symbol of my longing</i>

1587
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:31,810
<i>The spring willows
bloom eternally</i>

1588
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:35,561
<i>And spring flowers
fill my painted chambers</i>

1589
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:39,765
<i>My sleep's disturbed
by the wind and rain</i>

1590
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:43,811
<i>Pattering on the screen window
after dusk</i>

1591
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:47,970
<i>I'm unable to forget my new woes</i>

1592
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:51,761
<i>Or my old sorrows</i>

1593
02:36:52,440 --> 02:36:56,286
<i>I can't swallow my delicate foods</i>

1594
02:36:56,440 --> 02:37:00,286
<i>And I choke
on the golden brasenia soup</i>

1595
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:04,451
<i>I can't believe</i>

1596
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:08,486
<i>How frail I look
in my flowered mirror</i>

1597
02:37:08,720 --> 02:37:12,008
<i>I can't unfurrow my knitted brow</i>

1598
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:16,282
<i>Nor bear to feel
another tear fall</i>

1599
02:37:22,360 --> 02:37:24,601
Do you know Li Nan-tien?

1600
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:27,326
<i>Uh... yes.</i>

1601
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:29,331
<i>College classmate.</i>

1602
02:37:29,480 --> 02:37:31,482
So why didn't you write it down?

1603
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:34,769
<i>He didn't come to Taiwan.
We've lost contact.</i>

1604
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:36,968
Didn't come to Taiwan?

1605
02:37:38,320 --> 02:37:40,687
You know Liang Jin-chen?

1606
02:37:40,880 --> 02:37:43,451
<i>Liang Jin-chen?</i>

1607
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:46,841
<i>I don't think
I've heard the name before.</i>

1608
02:37:46,960 --> 02:37:50,009
Think carefully. Are you sure?

1609
02:37:51,320 --> 02:37:53,049
<i>I don</i> 7 <i>think so.</i>

1610
02:37:53,160 --> 02:37:55,049
Think carefully.

1611
02:37:58,280 --> 02:38:01,329
In July 1939 you began work
in an accounting department.

1612
02:38:01,440 --> 02:38:04,125
Who trained you
to take over his job?

1613
02:38:04,640 --> 02:38:06,608
<i>Oh... Mr. Liang.</i>

1614
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:10,210
<i>A sort, chubby guy
with gold-rimmed glasses.</i>

1615
02:38:10,360 --> 02:38:13,409
So you <i>do</i> remember.
Why didn't you write it down?

1616
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:15,890
<i>I wasn't lying.</i>

1617
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,844
We work so hard
to learn the truth.

1618
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:23,090
Leaving out something you know
is the same as lying.

1619
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:28,761
You know Chao Nien-lu?
- No.

1620
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:31,565
Hsun Feng-shih?
Kuo Li-an?

1621
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:33,125
<i>Yes.</i>

1622
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:38,043
Shih Chun-chuan?

1623
02:38:38,400 --> 02:38:39,890
<i>Shih Chun-chuan?</i>

1624
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:41,651
<i>Yes.</i>

1625
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:43,889
How do you know him?

1626
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:46,288
<i>He was a friend of a coworker.</i>

1627
02:38:46,400 --> 02:38:48,448
<i>When we first came to Taiwan,</i>

1628
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:51,245
<i>I bought an old bike
from him real cheap</i>

1629
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:54,921
<i>so the kids could get to school.
I only met him once.</i>

1630
02:38:56,560 --> 02:38:58,722
<i>A reporter or something.</i>

1631
02:38:58,880 --> 02:39:01,850
<i>His name was kind of odd.
That's why I remember it.</i>

1632
02:39:01,960 --> 02:39:03,246
Is that all?

1633
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:04,481
<i>Yes.</i>

1634
02:39:04,720 --> 02:39:07,610
Why didn't you write it down?
Who was the coworker?

1635
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:13,844
Mr. Tseng.

1636
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:17,885
Tseng Hung-yuan.
- How do you write that?

1637
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:19,331
“Hung” as in “swan.”

1638
02:39:19,440 --> 02:39:23,411
You and your wife married secretly
in Shanghai in 1940.

1639
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:25,443
We had witnesses
and a dinner-

1640
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:27,807
Without a marriage certificate,
it's a secret marriage.

1641
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:29,968
We registered at city hall,
and we -

1642
02:39:30,120 --> 02:39:32,726
Did Professor Hsia
introduce you to your wife?

1643
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:35,650
No, we met at a dance.

1644
02:39:35,760 --> 02:39:39,162
In June of 1942, your wife
was teaching elementary school.

1645
02:39:39,280 --> 02:39:41,521
Why did she resign?

1646
02:39:41,800 --> 02:39:44,121
My eldest daughter was born.

1647
02:39:44,560 --> 02:39:46,608
My salary was enough
at the time.

1648
02:39:46,760 --> 02:39:49,889
I preferred to have her
care for the baby.

1649
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,889
Is that the only reason?

1650
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:57,322
This says she left for her uncle's
in Shanghai at age 11.

1651
02:39:57,880 --> 02:40:01,771
Shouldn't it say
her father's brother-in-law?

1652
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:05,489
Well, I -

1653
02:40:05,960 --> 02:40:08,008
You seem to lack inspiration.

1654
02:40:08,160 --> 02:40:10,322
There's much
you still don't recall.

1655
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:13,609
Don't worry. We have
all the time in the world.

1656
02:40:58,360 --> 02:41:01,523
<i>You grow so fast.
Hold your breath.</i>

1657
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:08,403
<i>Remind me to let it out
for you tonight.</i>

1658
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:27,843
<i>What happened with your old man?</i>

1659
02:41:27,960 --> 02:41:29,291
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1660
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:32,768
<i>That night after the fight, did he notice
anything when you got home?</i>

1661
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:35,804
No, he'd gone to a movie
with my mom.

1662
02:41:37,560 --> 02:41:40,086
Wow, your sister's really cool!

1663
02:41:43,960 --> 02:41:45,450
Thanks.

1664
02:41:45,560 --> 02:41:47,085
Move.

1665
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,287
I found that picture
with the knife.

1666
02:42:15,400 --> 02:42:18,324
She must have used it
in a love suicide.

1667
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:25,091
Quit staring at it.
Take it if you want.

1668
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:31,964
Hey, I talked to Horsecart!
- What for?

1669
02:42:32,080 --> 02:42:35,129
I told him I'm your buddy.
He'll help us.

1670
02:42:36,280 --> 02:42:37,964
Stand up straight.

1671
02:42:44,200 --> 02:42:46,965
Don't make me repeat myself.

1672
02:42:48,480 --> 02:42:50,050
You got that?

1673
02:44:33,560 --> 02:44:35,562
There's no one here.

1674
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,002
I knew you'd be here.

1675
02:44:58,760 --> 02:45:00,888
What you told me last time...

1676
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,321
did you really mean it?

1677
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:18,767
I hope you weren't lying.

1678
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:21,807
I couldn't bear that.

1679
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:48,049
It's Saturday again.

1680
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:50,529
Want to cut class?

1681
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:56,844
No, we have all the time
in the world.

1682
02:46:04,440 --> 02:46:06,727
<i>Spring disappears</i>

1683
02:46:06,840 --> 02:46:08,649
<i>Without a trace</i>

1684
02:46:08,760 --> 02:46:13,846
<i>Leaving nothing behind...</i>

1685
02:46:24,360 --> 02:46:27,489
Here for your shot?
Go over there.

1686
02:46:59,400 --> 02:47:01,368
Apologize to them.

1687
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:03,525
Go on!

1688
02:47:03,720 --> 02:47:06,564
Want me to make you?

1689
02:47:07,360 --> 02:47:09,010
Motherfucker!

1690
02:47:11,240 --> 02:47:13,083
Is that good enough?

1691
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:15,726
Forget it. Let's go.

1692
02:47:15,920 --> 02:47:17,888
Not a chance!

1693
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:23,361
Just watch your step
from now on.

1694
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:36,047
What are you so pleased about?

1695
02:48:09,800 --> 02:48:12,201
Fix me up with Airplane!

1696
02:48:22,160 --> 02:48:23,810
Cat is cuter.

1697
02:48:23,920 --> 02:48:25,809
I want to meet Airplane!

1698
02:48:25,960 --> 02:48:27,485
I want one too!

1699
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:46,964
<i>You need to be
more aggressive on defense.</i>

1700
02:48:47,080 --> 02:48:50,482
<i>Don't let him get by.
Next two.</i>

1701
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:54,322
Keep your arms out on defense.
Go on.

1702
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:52,885
What's your connection
to Wang Kuo-cheng?

1703
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:56,563
Wang?

1704
02:49:58,080 --> 02:49:59,650
He's...

1705
02:50:02,240 --> 02:50:04,163
a classmate.

1706
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:05,964
“Wang”?

1707
02:50:07,160 --> 02:50:09,527
You seem to know him well.

1708
02:50:12,200 --> 02:50:14,407
Well... not really.

1709
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:19,287
I see him now and then
at class reunions.

1710
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:27,090
Here.

1711
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:34,642
Write more?

1712
02:50:47,320 --> 02:50:50,563
I'll be back for it before dawn.

1713
02:51:13,320 --> 02:51:15,641
I'm almost done.

1714
02:51:16,840 --> 02:51:19,081
Give me a little more time.

1715
02:51:20,880 --> 02:51:23,247
<i>That's enough.
You can go now.</i>

1716
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:25,324
<i>Hurry UP-</i>

1717
02:52:27,080 --> 02:52:29,970
- Hurry up.
- My button fell off again.

1718
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:33,205
- Didn't your sister just fix it for you?
- Yes.

1719
02:53:20,280 --> 02:53:22,123
Mrs. Zhang.

1720
02:53:30,480 --> 02:53:32,482
Do you have safety pins?

1721
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:38,600
You better go or you'll be late.

1722
02:53:57,920 --> 02:53:59,922
Is my shirt ironed?

1723
02:54:07,880 --> 02:54:10,008
I have to go to work.

1724
02:54:32,680 --> 02:54:34,682
It's better this way.

1725
02:54:35,960 --> 02:54:39,169
They found someone at the office
to take over my work.

1726
02:54:39,720 --> 02:54:42,087
Less work means less trouble.

1727
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:46,851
You think it's related
to your interrogation?

1728
02:54:51,360 --> 02:54:54,967
Don't say things with no proof.

1729
02:54:58,840 --> 02:55:00,808
How stupid can you be?

1730
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:04,971
Weren't they waiting for a confession
about Wang before they'd release you?

1731
02:55:06,320 --> 02:55:09,210
I thought
he was trying to help us.

1732
02:55:10,800 --> 02:55:12,370
The way I see it...

1733
02:55:12,560 --> 02:55:15,211
he was trying
to dissociate himself from you.

1734
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:18,051
You're too honest
to cover up his corruption.

1735
02:55:22,600 --> 02:55:24,887
What kind of crazy idea is that?

1736
02:55:26,200 --> 02:55:29,363
Didn't you go to him
while I was being held?

1737
02:55:30,240 --> 02:55:32,561
Didn't he do his best to help?

1738
02:55:33,360 --> 02:55:37,331
Maybe he was pretending.
Maybe he was behind the whole thing.

1739
02:55:37,880 --> 02:55:40,201
And that promotion he got you -

1740
02:55:40,320 --> 02:55:42,129
You women!

1741
02:55:42,880 --> 02:55:45,690
You know nothing
about friendship between men!

1742
02:55:46,040 --> 02:55:49,249
What are you good for
besides being suspicious?

1743
02:57:20,920 --> 02:57:23,366
It's been tough enough
for us already.

1744
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:31,241
You and the kids
are all I have left.

1745
02:57:39,080 --> 02:57:41,321
Please don't frighten me anymore.

1746
02:57:56,760 --> 02:57:59,366
We only have each other now.

1747
02:58:02,440 --> 02:58:06,161
If you're not afraid,
then I won't be.

1748
02:59:14,440 --> 02:59:16,966
What's the matter, Tiger?

1749
02:59:23,560 --> 02:59:25,483
Come on, speak up.

1750
02:59:42,800 --> 02:59:45,246
<i>You should at least talk to him.</i>

1751
02:59:48,240 --> 02:59:51,164
You worried
he'll try to get back at you?

1752
02:59:51,320 --> 02:59:52,810
He won't.

1753
02:59:54,240 --> 02:59:56,163
It's over.

1754
02:59:56,480 --> 02:59:58,323
Let's drop him, okay?

1755
03:00:03,360 --> 03:00:05,840
How come you never
told me about him?

1756
03:00:07,320 --> 03:00:09,402
What's there to tell?

1757
03:00:10,160 --> 03:00:12,162
Lots of guys have ideas about me.

1758
03:00:12,360 --> 03:00:15,011
Haven't you heard enough?

1759
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:21,329
Take the young doctor,
for example.

1760
03:00:22,520 --> 03:00:24,522
Couldn't you tell?

1761
03:00:27,240 --> 03:00:31,131
How do you feel
when I tell you these things?

1762
03:00:33,280 --> 03:00:36,170
Can't you just ignore them?

1763
03:00:37,760 --> 03:00:41,481
You can't ask others to do
what you think is right.

1764
03:01:02,480 --> 03:01:04,801
People will look down on you.

1765
03:01:07,280 --> 03:01:10,329
You mean you'll look down on me.

1766
03:01:35,160 --> 03:01:37,367
Who's there?

1767
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:41,361
Lao Er, Si'r, get up!

1768
03:01:41,480 --> 03:01:43,209
There's a thief!

1769
03:01:45,920 --> 03:01:48,082
Lao Er, get up, hurry!

1770
03:01:48,440 --> 03:01:50,169
Lao Er!

1771
03:01:50,440 --> 03:01:53,284
See if the front door's
been opened. Hurry!

1772
03:01:56,440 --> 03:01:58,124
The front door's fine.

1773
03:01:58,240 --> 03:01:59,446
You sure?

1774
03:01:59,600 --> 03:02:00,931
Yes.

1775
03:02:01,080 --> 03:02:02,650
Take this!

1776
03:02:04,800 --> 03:02:06,450
He's hiding.

1777
03:02:07,080 --> 03:02:08,366
He's hiding outside.

1778
03:02:08,520 --> 03:02:11,808
Impossible!
Check the roof!

1779
03:02:11,960 --> 03:02:14,167
- Get the flashlight.
- Where is it?

1780
03:02:14,280 --> 03:02:15,441
Hurry!

1781
03:02:15,560 --> 03:02:18,291
- Where is it?
- In the kitchen drawer. Hurry!

1782
03:02:18,400 --> 03:02:20,323
I can't find it.

1783
03:02:20,440 --> 03:02:23,011
Why don't you turn on some lights?

1784
03:02:23,480 --> 03:02:26,927
What's with all the noise?
I'm trying to sleep!

1785
03:02:33,600 --> 03:02:36,365
He's hiding under the bed.

1786
03:02:38,680 --> 03:02:42,480
He was standing right here
and then suddenly vanished!

1787
03:02:45,840 --> 03:02:48,320
It can't be!
I saw him right here!

1788
03:02:48,440 --> 03:02:50,522
How could he just vanish?

1789
03:02:50,840 --> 03:02:52,968
He couldn't have gotten away!

1790
03:03:15,200 --> 03:03:18,807
Let her rest for now.
Everything's under control.

1791
03:03:22,760 --> 03:03:25,206
Luckily you rushed her over
in time.

1792
03:03:26,240 --> 03:03:29,005
Didn't I warn her
about charcoal smoke?

1793
03:03:37,640 --> 03:03:41,087
Since ancient times
the Chinese have loved camellias

1794
03:03:41,200 --> 03:03:44,488
for their elegance
and refined beauty.

1795
03:03:48,280 --> 03:03:50,567
The kids used
to play around here

1796
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:53,246
and pick the flowers
when they were little.

1797
03:03:55,240 --> 03:03:58,881
This reminds me
of your grandfather.

1798
03:03:59,120 --> 03:04:03,523
The blossoms bring back
happy memories of him.

1799
03:04:30,160 --> 03:04:32,288
Who's that lady?

1800
03:04:34,400 --> 03:04:36,289
You mean Hsiang-Ii?

1801
03:04:36,840 --> 03:04:39,241
We're getting married
in September.

1802
03:04:46,240 --> 03:04:48,083
I don't like her.

1803
03:04:48,280 --> 03:04:50,089
She's strange.

1804
03:04:51,440 --> 03:04:55,126
There's no love between you.
She's not for you.

1805
03:05:00,680 --> 03:05:03,331
You kids don't understand
such things.

1806
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:09,207
You don't have to say anything
if you don't want to.

1807
03:05:12,920 --> 03:05:15,400
Why do you think
I don't understand?

1808
03:05:20,320 --> 03:05:23,085
Love isn't fun and games.

1809
03:05:26,280 --> 03:05:28,567
Lots of guys say they love me,

1810
03:05:28,960 --> 03:05:30,450
but...

1811
03:05:32,440 --> 03:05:35,842
the minute there's trouble,
they all run away.

1812
03:05:42,800 --> 03:05:44,689
If you're troubled about something,

1813
03:05:44,840 --> 03:05:47,366
you must tell me
before I can help you.

1814
03:05:57,360 --> 03:05:59,362
I won't tell you.

1815
03:05:59,720 --> 03:06:03,361
You wouldn't tell me, right?

1816
03:06:09,880 --> 03:06:13,441
Don't worry about
your mother's medical expenses.

1817
03:06:13,720 --> 03:06:17,088
We're too close
to worry about such things.

1818
03:06:29,560 --> 03:06:31,801
Still don't want to tell me?

1819
03:06:40,880 --> 03:06:42,405
<i>Zhang Zhen.</i>

1820
03:06:42,560 --> 03:06:44,562
<i>Come here a minute.</i>

1821
03:06:54,080 --> 03:06:56,526
<i>This is for your own good.</i>

1822
03:06:58,320 --> 03:07:00,368
<i>I don't mean to pry,</i>

1823
03:07:00,520 --> 03:07:04,081
<i>but for a love affair at your age,
you need good advice.</i>

1824
03:07:06,720 --> 03:07:09,041
Behaving like a hooligan, huh?

1825
03:07:09,160 --> 03:07:12,846
Stand up straight
when the doctor's talking!

1826
03:07:14,280 --> 03:07:16,282
Motherfucking bitch.

1827
03:07:16,400 --> 03:07:19,244
What are you?
The secret police?

1828
03:07:24,240 --> 03:07:25,924
What did you just say?

1829
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:28,691
Say that again.
What did you say?

1830
03:07:28,840 --> 03:07:30,490
I said you're the secret police.

1831
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:33,763
Before that.
About my mother.

1832
03:07:33,880 --> 03:07:36,281
Try saying it again!
- Fucking bitch!

1833
03:07:36,440 --> 03:07:39,125
<i>What's going on?</i>

1834
03:07:39,880 --> 03:07:41,291
What's this here?

1835
03:07:41,400 --> 03:07:44,643
Your students act
like a bunch of hooligans.

1836
03:07:44,760 --> 03:07:47,127
Foul-mouthed and violent!

1837
03:07:47,240 --> 03:07:50,323
Dating girls and messing around
with relationships!

1838
03:07:50,480 --> 03:07:52,323
- Mind your own fucking business!
- Zhang Zhen!

1839
03:07:52,440 --> 03:07:54,363
To the conduct office!

1840
03:07:54,480 --> 03:07:56,482
Big deal! Who cares?

1841
03:08:01,640 --> 03:08:04,291
You had some harsh words
about us last time.

1842
03:08:04,400 --> 03:08:06,164
What about
your parental guidance?

1843
03:08:06,280 --> 03:08:09,090
<i>Such foul language!
Even I was embarrassed.</i>

1844
03:08:11,040 --> 03:08:14,442
You parents don't do your job
and then blame it on us.

1845
03:08:14,560 --> 03:08:16,483
You have some nerve!

1846
03:08:20,280 --> 03:08:22,601
Please give him another chance.

1847
03:08:22,720 --> 03:08:24,324
Too late!

1848
03:08:25,280 --> 03:08:29,285
He's fallen this far already.
If we don't punish him properly,

1849
03:08:29,920 --> 03:08:32,890
you'll blame us again
for not doing our job.

1850
03:08:33,320 --> 03:08:36,369
I don't want to be
responsible for that.

1851
03:08:37,120 --> 03:08:38,804
It was my negligence.

1852
03:08:39,440 --> 03:08:41,522
Kids sometimes lose their heads.

1853
03:08:42,160 --> 03:08:44,527
Please excuse him just this once.

1854
03:08:46,560 --> 03:08:48,688
If he gets
another demerit for this,

1855
03:08:48,800 --> 03:08:51,565
he can't move on
to the next grade.

1856
03:08:53,200 --> 03:08:55,043
That would be...

1857
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,082
too unfair to him.

1858
03:08:58,840 --> 03:09:02,242
Unfair? Didn't you think
we were unfair last time?

1859
03:09:02,360 --> 03:09:06,046
Didn't you say
you didn't care about demerits?

1860
03:09:07,080 --> 03:09:09,082
How come you care now?

1861
03:09:11,240 --> 03:09:14,084
We all work
for the same government.

1862
03:09:14,200 --> 03:09:16,328
What makes you
so high and mighty?

1863
03:09:45,600 --> 03:09:47,967
<i>Mr. Zhang, buy some buns!</i>

1864
03:09:50,440 --> 03:09:52,522
What's wrong?
In a bad mood?

1865
03:09:52,640 --> 03:09:54,244
Don't worry!

1866
03:09:55,480 --> 03:09:58,086
The sun will rise again tomorrow.

1867
03:09:58,240 --> 03:10:01,528
A lively soul is never
stifled by a fart, right?

1868
03:10:03,240 --> 03:10:05,163
Dumplings and buns!

1869
03:10:06,080 --> 03:10:09,801
Don't worry, Dad.
Getting expelled isn't that bad.

1870
03:10:10,520 --> 03:10:13,330
This way I can take
the transfer exam this summer.

1871
03:10:13,440 --> 03:10:15,807
I'll get into day school for you.

1872
03:10:19,080 --> 03:10:21,606
Don't worry about me, Dad.

1873
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:25,287
I remember everything you said.

1874
03:10:25,840 --> 03:10:28,127
I'll always listen to you.

1875
03:10:31,120 --> 03:10:34,567
I remember you said
one's own future

1876
03:10:34,680 --> 03:10:37,331
can be determined
by one's own efforts.

1877
03:10:42,040 --> 03:10:46,090
I hit him with the bat
because he went too far,

1878
03:10:46,640 --> 03:10:48,688
just like last time when you -

1879
03:10:59,240 --> 03:11:01,242
If I quit smoking,

1880
03:11:01,640 --> 03:11:04,166
the money I save every month...

1881
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:07,967
will be enough
to buy you glasses

1882
03:11:08,360 --> 03:11:10,249
on the installment plan.

1883
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:20,844
So when will we see
each other again?

1884
03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:25,921
Not until I've taken
the transfer exams.

1885
03:11:26,800 --> 03:11:29,644
You can always come
to school to see me.

1886
03:11:30,680 --> 03:11:35,242
Next time I enter the school gate,
<i>I'll</i> be a day school student.

1887
03:11:36,720 --> 03:11:40,520
Sounds like Honey when he said
he was going back to Tainan.

1888
03:11:41,360 --> 03:11:43,249
You're not happy.

1889
03:11:47,040 --> 03:11:48,963
I'll be worried about you.

1890
03:11:49,840 --> 03:11:51,888
Don't be silly. Study hard.

1891
03:11:52,360 --> 03:11:54,362
I'm behind you all the way.

1892
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,606
But let's not go today, okay?

1893
03:11:58,200 --> 03:12:00,123
Everything's all arranged.

1894
03:12:00,720 --> 03:12:03,564
Plus Cat and Airplane
are both invited.

1895
03:12:12,360 --> 03:12:15,682
Oh, dear!
Our servant has quit.

1896
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:18,924
Sorry I didn't come out
earlier to say hello.

1897
03:12:19,440 --> 03:12:22,569
Don't worry.
We'll help ourselves.

1898
03:12:22,960 --> 03:12:24,769
Is this your classmate?

1899
03:12:24,880 --> 03:12:26,450
She's so pretty.

1900
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:30,243
When I was carrying him,
I wanted a girl.

1901
03:12:30,400 --> 03:12:32,243
Look how big he is now.

1902
03:12:32,360 --> 03:12:34,124
There you go again!

1903
03:12:34,280 --> 03:12:37,011
Take your feet off the table.

1904
03:12:37,520 --> 03:12:39,887
Where are the others?

1905
03:12:40,360 --> 03:12:42,806
<i>- Range?
- 700 yards.</i>

1906
03:12:43,520 --> 03:12:45,648
<i>- How many?
- A platoon.</i>

1907
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:48,043
<i>Too far. It won't reach.</i>

1908
03:12:48,200 --> 03:12:49,850
<i>Use mine.</i>

1909
03:12:52,200 --> 03:12:53,884
<i>Shit! They've got tanks!</i>

1910
03:12:54,040 --> 03:12:56,281
<i>It's okay.
We've got grenades.</i>

1911
03:12:58,240 --> 03:13:00,004
Who goes there? Password!

1912
03:13:00,120 --> 03:13:02,964
Commie woman.
Hands up.

1913
03:13:03,120 --> 03:13:05,805
- What are you doing?
- Girls aren't into this stuff.

1914
03:13:05,960 --> 03:13:08,247
Stay back!

1915
03:13:16,520 --> 03:13:19,490
Cheer up, will you?

1916
03:13:19,880 --> 03:13:22,247
Doesn't my thoughtfulness
mean anything?

1917
03:13:23,320 --> 03:13:25,641
Getting expelled from school
is no big deal.

1918
03:13:25,800 --> 03:13:28,485
You don't even look
after your own girlfriend.

1919
03:15:29,240 --> 03:15:31,925
Your father's government career

1920
03:15:32,040 --> 03:15:34,247
is doomed because of it

1921
03:15:34,520 --> 03:15:37,285
and because of his relations
with Professor Hsia.

1922
03:15:40,800 --> 03:15:43,770
I'm proud of all you kids
for pulling through.

1923
03:15:43,960 --> 03:15:47,009
Especially Si'r.

1924
03:15:47,480 --> 03:15:51,769
He's so determined to get back
on track after all that's happened.

1925
03:15:54,280 --> 03:15:58,763
Mom, after graduation,
I'll work a while before going abroad.

1926
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:03,085
No, you go as soon as you get
your scholarship.

1927
03:16:03,200 --> 03:16:07,091
But Lao Er's going to college,
plus there's Si'r and the youngest one.

1928
03:16:07,200 --> 03:16:09,248
It's too much for you.

1929
03:16:09,400 --> 03:16:11,209
We've managed up to now.

1930
03:16:11,360 --> 03:16:14,330
Don't worry until
you've made it in America.

1931
03:16:14,480 --> 03:16:16,403
Four pounds of rice.

1932
03:16:16,520 --> 03:16:19,364
Can you put this on credit,
Uncle Fat?

1933
03:16:19,480 --> 03:16:21,084
No problem.

1934
03:16:21,560 --> 03:16:23,085
May I butt in?

1935
03:16:23,200 --> 03:16:25,202
Many people say I'm too nosy,

1936
03:16:25,560 --> 03:16:27,688
but I'm actually
a lot like your husband.

1937
03:16:27,800 --> 03:16:29,609
You have preserved eggs?

1938
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:31,490
Over there.

1939
03:16:34,840 --> 03:16:37,286
<i>Your SH saved my “fie.</i>

1940
03:16:38,720 --> 03:16:42,486
I think it's my turn to help you.

1941
03:16:46,800 --> 03:16:49,565
Uncle Fat said Mr. Lin
is native Taiwanese.

1942
03:16:49,680 --> 03:16:51,444
A very honest man.

1943
03:16:51,800 --> 03:16:54,371
He's starting
a fruit export business.

1944
03:16:54,480 --> 03:16:57,643
He needs a partner
with formal education.

1945
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:05,601
The starting salary
may not be much,

1946
03:17:06,280 --> 03:17:10,046
but if you work hard,
you'll be your own man.

1947
03:17:17,200 --> 03:17:20,010
What if he goes bankrupt
a month from now?

1948
03:17:21,080 --> 03:17:23,890
Talk to him first.
Feel each other out.

1949
03:17:24,240 --> 03:17:27,562
You can't doubt a guy
without knowing him.

1950
03:17:32,880 --> 03:17:35,724
I've worked
for the government all my life.

1951
03:17:36,320 --> 03:17:39,244
I'm used
to the stability and security.

1952
03:17:39,360 --> 03:17:42,409
You really think
this is stable and secure?

1953
03:17:48,240 --> 03:17:51,767
I was gonna mail it today
if you didn't show up.

1954
03:17:52,240 --> 03:17:55,881
<i>Did you bring your friend
some slippers, Cat?</i>

1955
03:18:14,280 --> 03:18:16,521
What did I go out there for?

1956
03:18:16,640 --> 03:18:18,449
Why'd you turn it off?

1957
03:18:18,560 --> 03:18:20,801
It sounds awful!
Who are you mailing it to?

1958
03:18:20,920 --> 03:18:23,048
You'll find out later.

1959
03:18:25,520 --> 03:18:27,682
How's school?
Everything okay?

1960
03:18:27,800 --> 03:18:30,883
Same as always.
Nothing ever changes.

1961
03:18:33,160 --> 03:18:35,049
You seen Ming lately?

1962
03:18:35,160 --> 03:18:37,606
She's fine!

1963
03:18:37,720 --> 03:18:39,449
Just concentrate on your books.

1964
03:18:39,600 --> 03:18:41,887
Me and Airplane
will look after her.

1965
03:19:02,320 --> 03:19:04,971
Chiung, come give me a hand.

1966
03:19:05,240 --> 03:19:07,766
Uncle Fat's family
will be here at 7:00.

1967
03:19:12,040 --> 03:19:14,042
Clear the table, would you?

1968
03:19:17,320 --> 03:19:18,651
<i>Where's Sh'?</i>

1969
03:19:19,360 --> 03:19:21,408
I sent him to the movies.

1970
03:19:37,880 --> 03:19:42,010
“The score with Sly
will be settled by this day.”

1971
03:19:47,640 --> 03:19:49,130
Sly?

1972
03:19:49,760 --> 03:19:52,286
He hasn't come around in ages.

1973
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:57,528
He disappeared
after he escaped the massacre.

1974
03:19:58,840 --> 03:20:01,491
They fired his old man
because of him.

1975
03:20:03,360 --> 03:20:06,728
They hold political meetings
in the auditorium,

1976
03:20:06,880 --> 03:20:09,201
but outsiders
can't rent it anymore.

1977
03:20:10,200 --> 03:20:12,441
I got the worst of it.

1978
03:20:12,600 --> 03:20:14,967
My business has gone to hell.

1979
03:20:15,160 --> 03:20:18,243
The damn cops
come round all the time.

1980
03:20:22,400 --> 03:20:24,243
<i>Closing up already?</i>

1981
03:20:24,400 --> 03:20:26,607
Shit! Look who's here!

1982
03:20:32,400 --> 03:20:33,890
<i>Sh.</i>

1983
03:20:46,720 --> 03:20:50,406
Jade said she's been
seeing you at the library.

1984
03:20:51,280 --> 03:20:54,090
You got kicked
out of school too?

1985
03:20:57,760 --> 03:20:59,603
You seem really different.

1986
03:20:59,760 --> 03:21:01,285
Move your feet.

1987
03:21:08,760 --> 03:21:10,922
I was really too much back then...

1988
03:21:12,120 --> 03:21:14,282
wound up so tight all the time.

1989
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:17,128
It makes me laugh!

1990
03:21:21,080 --> 03:21:24,163
Don't let the past
get you down, okay?

1991
03:21:26,200 --> 03:21:28,282
I feel really bad about it.

1992
03:21:33,640 --> 03:21:36,405
Come on, man.
It was all my fault.

1993
03:21:36,760 --> 03:21:38,364
Let it go.

1994
03:21:40,640 --> 03:21:42,847
What school
are you trying to get into?

1995
03:21:43,360 --> 03:21:45,886
I'm trying to test
into day school.

1996
03:21:47,920 --> 03:21:49,763
You got some balls!

1997
03:21:51,960 --> 03:21:55,646
Even military academies
won't take punks like me.

1998
03:21:56,920 --> 03:21:59,207
You and I were such enemies.

1999
03:21:59,440 --> 03:22:01,363
Now we're in the same boat.

2000
03:22:01,560 --> 03:22:04,484
We even have the same
bad luck with girlfriends.

2001
03:22:06,320 --> 03:22:08,243
What do you mean?

2002
03:22:08,920 --> 03:22:10,490
That Ma!

2003
03:22:11,680 --> 03:22:13,682
He's really slick.

2004
03:22:15,560 --> 03:22:19,201
I figure you'll be like me
and not hold it against him.

2005
03:22:20,160 --> 03:22:22,162
He stole Jade from me.

2006
03:22:22,640 --> 03:22:24,802
Now he's messing around
with Ming.

2007
03:22:28,520 --> 03:22:30,807
When are you signing up
for the exams?

2008
03:22:30,920 --> 03:22:33,287
My math and English
are the pits -

2009
03:22:33,920 --> 03:22:35,490
<i>Sh.</i>

2010
03:22:38,160 --> 03:22:40,128
Let's keep in touch.

2011
03:22:41,840 --> 03:22:45,242
What was that for?
You want trouble, asshole?

2012
03:22:45,360 --> 03:22:47,806
Mess with me
and <i>I'll</i> call the cops!

2013
03:22:47,920 --> 03:22:51,288
Motherfucker!
- Come on, forget it.

2014
03:22:53,640 --> 03:22:56,689
<i>- Who are you here to see?
- Is Ma home?</i>

2015
03:22:56,800 --> 03:22:58,290
<i>Wait here.</i>

2016
03:23:02,560 --> 03:23:04,050
What's your name?

2017
03:23:04,200 --> 03:23:05,884
<i>Si 'r.</i>

2018
03:23:32,280 --> 03:23:35,762
Shit, it's been a long time!
What have you been up to?

2019
03:23:36,040 --> 03:23:38,088
That's what I want to ask you.

2020
03:23:38,760 --> 03:23:40,967
I'm the same old me.
What else?

2021
03:23:41,920 --> 03:23:45,527
Hey, did you know
Ming's living here now?

2022
03:23:46,080 --> 03:23:48,162
Remember when you guys came over

2023
03:23:48,320 --> 03:23:50,163
and our maid had quit?

2024
03:23:50,760 --> 03:23:54,651
Ming came to my mom to see
if her mother could fill the job.

2025
03:23:54,800 --> 03:23:58,247
My mom really likes her
and gave her mother the job.

2026
03:23:58,680 --> 03:24:00,444
Ming's not bad.

2027
03:24:01,560 --> 03:24:04,006
She's inside.
Want to come in?

2028
03:24:05,280 --> 03:24:07,521
What's this I hear
about you and her?

2029
03:24:08,360 --> 03:24:10,089
What do you mean?

2030
03:24:10,200 --> 03:24:12,487
Girls. It's the same old shit.

2031
03:24:12,600 --> 03:24:15,729
Dress 'em nice, feed 'em well,
fool around a bit.

2032
03:24:15,840 --> 03:24:17,649
What else is there?

2033
03:24:22,440 --> 03:24:24,920
You don't look too happy.

2034
03:24:26,280 --> 03:24:29,841
Don't let some stupid girl
come between us, buddy.

2035
03:24:31,320 --> 03:24:32,810
It's okay.

2036
03:24:34,600 --> 03:24:38,321
When you two were fooling around,
did she mention Honey a lot...

2037
03:24:38,720 --> 03:24:41,564
and say you weren't giving her
a sense of security?

2038
03:24:43,840 --> 03:24:48,004
What's wrong? Don't get
all worked up over some girl!

2039
03:24:48,240 --> 03:24:50,925
Come on in.
Let's shoot a few rounds.

2040
03:24:51,120 --> 03:24:53,407
That's okay.
I'm gonna catch a movie.

2041
03:25:13,360 --> 03:25:15,966
- Got any money on you?
- <i>A</i> little.

2042
03:25:16,680 --> 03:25:18,045
How much?

2043
03:25:18,200 --> 03:25:20,202
<i>How much you need?</i>

2044
03:25:21,680 --> 03:25:23,409
Never mind.

2045
03:26:00,680 --> 03:26:04,446
Look at it
as meeting friends for dinner.

2046
03:26:04,560 --> 03:26:06,403
Just be relaxed.

2047
03:26:08,440 --> 03:26:11,125
Chuan, I need my watch.

2048
03:26:11,240 --> 03:26:13,129
<i>I put it back.</i>

2049
03:26:13,400 --> 03:26:15,209
Well, it's not here.

2050
03:26:16,080 --> 03:26:18,003
<i>Uncle Fat's here.</i>

2051
03:26:31,480 --> 03:26:34,245
- I want to go.
- I'll bring you bubble gum.

2052
03:26:34,440 --> 03:26:36,169
Lousy bubble gum!

2053
03:26:46,320 --> 03:26:48,891
How many for dinner?

2054
03:26:49,280 --> 03:26:52,045
Si'r is studying at the library.

2055
03:26:53,760 --> 03:26:55,285
How about Lao Er?

2056
03:26:55,440 --> 03:26:57,283
I don't know.

2057
03:26:59,880 --> 03:27:02,531
He's had a good appetite lately.

2058
03:27:07,640 --> 03:27:09,324
What's wrong?

2059
03:27:14,600 --> 03:27:16,807
<i>You're always outside
whenever Mom's gone.</i>

2060
03:27:16,960 --> 03:27:18,564
<i>Come eat your dinner!</i>

2061
03:27:18,680 --> 03:27:20,648
I'm not hungry yet.

2062
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:25,480
- You're asking for it!
- I'm coming.

2063
03:27:25,600 --> 03:27:29,161
- Is stealing Mom's watch a habit now?
- I didn't take it.

2064
03:27:29,280 --> 03:27:32,523
She noticed it was gone!
What will you do now?

2065
03:27:34,640 --> 03:27:36,130
What's this about?

2066
03:27:36,360 --> 03:27:39,011
It's for grown-ups.
Stay out of it.

2067
03:27:39,160 --> 03:27:41,003
You're so mean!

2068
03:27:41,800 --> 03:27:43,450
Where are you going?

2069
03:27:43,600 --> 03:27:47,161
- Are your folks home?
- They went out to dinner.

2070
03:27:47,280 --> 03:27:49,726
- What's with Lao Er?
- Oh, nothing.

2071
03:27:50,000 --> 03:27:52,401
It's been ages.
Are they doing all right?

2072
03:27:52,560 --> 03:27:54,801
<i>I'll</i> come in a while and wait.

2073
03:27:59,720 --> 03:28:02,803
Where are all the ashtrays?

2074
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:09,843
Dad quit smoking.

2075
03:28:16,760 --> 03:28:19,127
You still using this thing?

2076
03:28:24,560 --> 03:28:26,528
It's useless!

2077
03:28:28,320 --> 03:28:32,644
You know, I took your dad
to buy this radio.

2078
03:28:33,880 --> 03:28:36,724
At the Wing On
department store in Shanghai.

2079
03:28:37,200 --> 03:28:40,921
Your mom wasn't even
as old as you are now.

2080
03:28:46,920 --> 03:28:49,571
You should throw
that useless junk away.

2081
03:28:49,880 --> 03:28:52,611
What were you doing
at the church library?

2082
03:28:52,720 --> 03:28:55,610
My sister told me about it.
How about you?

2083
03:28:55,720 --> 03:28:59,406
I play when it's time to play,
study when it's time to study.

2084
03:29:00,960 --> 03:29:03,327
So Chiung is your sister?

2085
03:29:05,600 --> 03:29:07,364
She's really religious.

2086
03:29:07,480 --> 03:29:10,723
We were both
in the church choir at one point.

2087
03:29:14,200 --> 03:29:17,363
What'll we do after the movie?
- Some rock and roll joint?

2088
03:29:17,520 --> 03:29:19,249
No, too expensive.

2089
03:29:19,400 --> 03:29:22,370
You want to be like Ma?
Don't be stupid.

2090
03:29:24,760 --> 03:29:27,081
Didn't you quit?

2091
03:29:35,200 --> 03:29:37,441
How about 300 a game?

2092
03:29:39,280 --> 03:29:41,886
Shit!
You need money that bad?

2093
03:29:51,280 --> 03:29:53,328
This is a real opportunity for you.

2094
03:29:53,440 --> 03:29:57,126
I was impressed with Mr. Lin.
He's honest and direct.

2095
03:29:57,680 --> 03:29:59,762
It's time to stop
dragging your feet.

2096
03:29:59,920 --> 03:30:02,207
<i>Dad, Mr. Wang was here.</i>

2097
03:30:07,720 --> 03:30:10,200
I forgot your bubble gum!

2098
03:30:10,640 --> 03:30:13,530
I'll make it up to you next time.

2099
03:30:14,960 --> 03:30:17,850
Why the sad face?
- Big sister bawled me out.

2100
03:30:18,000 --> 03:30:20,048
She did?
Were you naughty?

2101
03:30:20,160 --> 03:30:21,571
No.

2102
03:30:21,680 --> 03:30:23,523
Then why'd she do that?

2103
03:30:30,040 --> 03:30:32,725
- Where's Lao Er?
- He went out.

2104
03:30:32,840 --> 03:30:34,842
Where'd he go?

2105
03:30:36,800 --> 03:30:40,361
Little brat!
Just had to snitch, didn't you!

2106
03:30:45,520 --> 03:30:48,000
<i>I saw Sly last night.</i>

2107
03:30:48,760 --> 03:30:50,808
<i>He's totally changed.</i>

2108
03:30:52,480 --> 03:30:54,721
<i>I guess people really do change.</i>

2109
03:30:55,680 --> 03:30:58,684
<i>It was a comforting feeling.</i>

2110
03:30:59,720 --> 03:31:02,041
What are you going on about?

2111
03:31:04,080 --> 03:31:07,880
Jade, can we be close
to each other?

2112
03:31:09,600 --> 03:31:12,922
I could help you feel
that same way.

2113
03:31:14,200 --> 03:31:16,726
Don't you need that sometimes?

2114
03:31:18,160 --> 03:31:20,208
You're a serious one,
aren't you?

2115
03:31:20,360 --> 03:31:22,886
Didn't you look down
on me before?

2116
03:31:23,160 --> 03:31:24,207
Actually -

2117
03:31:24,320 --> 03:31:26,926
Now you seem eager to change me.

2118
03:31:28,400 --> 03:31:31,085
Am I your little
biology experiment, or what?

2119
03:31:31,800 --> 03:31:34,804
You have a lot
of philosophical ideas.

2120
03:31:38,240 --> 03:31:41,926
I'm happy with the way I am,
but are you?

2121
03:31:43,960 --> 03:31:45,928
What if I don't change?

2122
03:31:47,560 --> 03:31:50,245
What if I don't change
to suit your ideas?

2123
03:31:50,400 --> 03:31:52,562
Will you just walk away?

2124
03:31:54,920 --> 03:31:58,322
You're so selfish!
Who do you think you are?

2125
03:32:11,000 --> 03:32:13,401
Jade, I didn't mean any harm.

2126
03:32:16,960 --> 03:32:20,931
By the way, thanks for the rumors
you started back then.

2127
03:32:21,680 --> 03:32:24,206
What rumors? Back when?

2128
03:32:24,680 --> 03:32:26,648
Playing dumb?

2129
03:32:26,760 --> 03:32:30,128
When the 217 boys
cornered Sly at the school.

2130
03:32:30,240 --> 03:32:34,040
Did you really not see
it was Ming he was with?

2131
03:32:34,440 --> 03:32:37,887
Sly was scared
Honey might find out.

2132
03:32:38,000 --> 03:32:40,651
He made me tell everyone
it was me.

2133
03:32:40,800 --> 03:32:43,007
I was such an idiot!

2134
03:32:44,160 --> 03:32:46,640
Why don't you give Ming
your philosophy lecture?

2135
03:32:46,800 --> 03:32:49,121
She's got me beat by a mile.

2136
03:33:13,160 --> 03:33:16,323
You're shameless!
Hopeless!

2137
03:33:17,680 --> 03:33:20,047
Tell your father you're sorry.

2138
03:33:21,960 --> 03:33:24,645
That's enough, Dad.

2139
03:33:26,480 --> 03:33:28,209
That's enough, Dad.

2140
03:33:30,720 --> 03:33:32,370
That's enough!

2141
03:33:34,040 --> 03:33:36,566
Dad, please stop!

2142
03:33:42,160 --> 03:33:44,083
Please stop!

2143
03:34:29,760 --> 03:34:32,366
You better come back later.

2144
03:34:32,760 --> 03:34:36,048
Mom and Dad think
you're studying at the library.

2145
03:34:36,600 --> 03:34:39,524
If they find out
you took the watch...

2146
03:34:40,360 --> 03:34:42,931
they'll be even more heartbroken.

2147
03:34:45,240 --> 03:34:47,925
Lao Er came up
with a load of cash.

2148
03:34:49,320 --> 03:34:52,290
He wanted to buy back
the watch for you...

2149
03:34:53,080 --> 03:34:56,163
but Mom found
the money on him first.

2150
03:35:01,960 --> 03:35:03,962
You mustn't feel alone.

2151
03:35:05,320 --> 03:35:07,561
I'm always with you.

2152
03:35:08,240 --> 03:35:10,527
Don't turn me away again.

2153
03:35:10,720 --> 03:35:14,611
Let God into your heart.
He'll give you his strength.

2154
03:35:16,440 --> 03:35:17,805
But...

2155
03:35:18,640 --> 03:35:20,768
there's too much suffering...

2156
03:35:21,200 --> 03:35:23,168
too much injustice.

2157
03:35:25,040 --> 03:35:27,691
Aren't you giving others
too little credit

2158
03:35:28,280 --> 03:35:31,363
and always thinking
only of yourself?

2159
03:35:32,160 --> 03:35:33,924
Christ gave his life

2160
03:35:34,400 --> 03:35:36,243
for our sins.

2161
03:35:37,640 --> 03:35:42,646
Even Lao Er took the blame
for your wrongs.

2162
03:35:44,160 --> 03:35:47,323
You should show gratitude
for what others have done for you.

2163
03:35:47,800 --> 03:35:50,804
Have you ever done
anything for anyone?

2164
03:35:52,200 --> 03:35:54,646
You should think it over carefully.

2165
03:35:59,000 --> 03:36:00,889
Honey told me the same thing.

2166
03:36:01,000 --> 03:36:02,081
Who?

2167
03:36:03,520 --> 03:36:05,204
Never mind.

2168
03:36:05,680 --> 03:36:07,603
A good friend.

2169
03:36:12,040 --> 03:36:16,011
Have you ever read
War and Peace <i>?</i>

2170
03:36:18,160 --> 03:36:21,369
Why don't you talk it over
with Reverend Chen tomorrow?

2171
03:36:34,520 --> 03:36:36,841
- What's up?
- We're not finished yet.

2172
03:36:37,000 --> 03:36:40,209
- What's this about?
- Don't play dumb, asshole.

2173
03:36:40,360 --> 03:36:43,921
Fuck you, going off on me
over some girl!

2174
03:36:44,040 --> 03:36:45,565
Aren't you my bUddY?

2175
03:36:45,720 --> 03:36:47,768
You go on like an old lady.

2176
03:36:47,880 --> 03:36:50,326
You said you'd given up
girls for books.

2177
03:36:50,440 --> 03:36:53,330
Now you start bitching.
You got some nerve!

2178
03:36:53,440 --> 03:36:55,966
I've always been good to you.
- Shut your mouth!

2179
03:36:56,440 --> 03:36:58,408
Shut your mouth and listen good.

2180
03:36:58,520 --> 03:37:01,000
I've had enough
of your rich-kid theories.

2181
03:37:01,320 --> 03:37:02,924
Starting today...

2182
03:37:03,040 --> 03:37:05,771
if I hear you're still
hanging out with Ming,

2183
03:37:05,880 --> 03:37:08,884
I'm coming after you!

2184
03:37:14,320 --> 03:37:17,449
Motherfuckin' punk!
I let you be my best friend!

2185
03:37:17,560 --> 03:37:21,645
Fuck! Don't forget
who you're messing with!

2186
03:37:21,760 --> 03:37:24,764
<i>I'll</i> be waitin' for you, buddy!

2187
03:37:24,880 --> 03:37:27,087
I'll kick your ass!

2188
03:37:29,240 --> 03:37:32,767
I've been looking all over for you.
Cool it. We're all good friends.

2189
03:37:33,160 --> 03:37:35,447
Cool it for my sake, okay?

2190
03:37:36,320 --> 03:37:39,085
Let's talk it over.
<i>I'll</i> bring him to you.

2191
03:37:39,240 --> 03:37:42,369
Come on, man.
Don't act this way.

2192
03:37:44,200 --> 03:37:46,248
It makes us look bad.

2193
03:37:46,360 --> 03:37:48,044
Wait at the film studio.

2194
03:37:48,200 --> 03:37:50,931
<i>I'll</i> go talk to him.
<i>I'll</i> bring him to you.

2195
03:37:51,160 --> 03:37:53,322
Cool it for my sake.

2196
03:37:53,600 --> 03:37:55,602
Come on, man.

2197
03:38:07,160 --> 03:38:10,562
Let's drop it for today.
I need time to talk to him.

2198
03:38:10,720 --> 03:38:13,121
He brought
his samurai sword to class.

2199
03:38:13,280 --> 03:38:15,601
Let's do it tomorrow, okay?

2200
03:38:15,720 --> 03:38:18,007
Go home and cool down.

2201
03:38:18,280 --> 03:38:21,204
Do it for me, okay?

2202
03:38:21,480 --> 03:38:23,801
Let's make it tomorrow, okay?

2203
03:38:24,160 --> 03:38:26,447
Okay? For sure?

2204
03:38:26,760 --> 03:38:29,491
I gotta go.
I'm late for class.

2205
03:39:23,720 --> 03:39:25,484
Your brother's not here yet?

2206
03:39:25,600 --> 03:39:28,206
My family said he was on his way.

2207
03:39:28,680 --> 03:39:30,125
Well...

2208
03:39:30,640 --> 03:39:32,847
let's wait another half hour.

2209
03:39:32,960 --> 03:39:35,691
- I'm sorry, Reverend Chen.
- It's okay.

2210
03:39:36,040 --> 03:39:38,566
Well... excuse me.

2211
03:40:06,080 --> 03:40:07,650
Hey there!

2212
03:40:09,880 --> 03:40:13,771
Can you help me find
that young girl you were with before?

2213
03:40:13,960 --> 03:40:16,884
She moved after the screen test.

2214
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:18,923
You know where to?

2215
03:40:19,080 --> 03:40:23,085
She cries and laughs,
and makes it all look natural!

2216
03:40:23,200 --> 03:40:24,611
Natural?

2217
03:40:25,000 --> 03:40:27,446
You can't even tell real from fake.

2218
03:40:27,560 --> 03:40:29,562
How can you make movies?

2219
03:40:31,480 --> 03:40:34,450
You even know
what the hell you're filming?

2220
03:40:41,600 --> 03:40:43,284
<i>Cat's at school.</i>

2221
03:40:43,440 --> 03:40:45,283
<i>I'm just borro wing a book.</i>

2222
03:40:45,440 --> 03:40:46,646
<i>What book?</i>

2223
03:40:46,760 --> 03:40:48,762
<i>I know where it is.</i>

2224
03:41:45,920 --> 03:41:48,366
How come his bike's still here?

2225
03:41:48,520 --> 03:41:52,411
Strange. He's usually
the first one out of here.

2226
03:41:57,400 --> 03:41:59,084
Si?!

2227
03:42:19,040 --> 03:42:20,883
What's the matter?

2228
03:42:22,040 --> 03:42:24,441
What brings you here to school?

2229
03:42:27,040 --> 03:42:28,769
What's that?

2230
03:42:31,080 --> 03:42:33,560
Stop acting like this.
What's that?

2231
03:42:44,120 --> 03:42:46,282
You're here for Ma.

2232
03:42:48,560 --> 03:42:50,449
Tell me! Are you?

2233
03:42:52,680 --> 03:42:55,081
How could you do
a thing like that?

2234
03:42:56,240 --> 03:42:58,447
I won't let anyone
look down on you.

2235
03:42:59,760 --> 03:43:01,762
What are you talking about?

2236
03:43:05,160 --> 03:43:07,845
Aren't you supposed
to be home studying?

2237
03:43:14,640 --> 03:43:17,769
Ming, I know all about you.

2238
03:43:18,360 --> 03:43:20,010
But I don't mind.

2239
03:43:20,440 --> 03:43:22,090
Because only I know.

2240
03:43:22,240 --> 03:43:24,527
I'm the only one
who can help you.

2241
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:27,526
I'm the only hope you have left.

2242
03:43:27,960 --> 03:43:30,088
Just like Honey used to be.

2243
03:43:30,720 --> 03:43:33,451
That's why
you still can't forget Honey.

2244
03:43:35,040 --> 03:43:38,123
Because right now,
I'm another Honey.

2245
03:43:43,440 --> 03:43:47,126
You mean you're the only one
who can help change me, right?

2246
03:43:47,840 --> 03:43:50,127
Why are you like all the rest?

2247
03:43:51,040 --> 03:43:54,522
I was wrong about you.
You're just like the others.

2248
03:43:54,640 --> 03:43:58,042
You're nice to me
just so I'll be nice to you.

2249
03:43:59,440 --> 03:44:01,647
Then you'll feel secure, right?

2250
03:44:02,440 --> 03:44:04,090
You're so selfish.

2251
03:44:05,360 --> 03:44:07,169
You want to change me?

2252
03:44:07,280 --> 03:44:09,248
I'm like this world.

2253
03:44:09,360 --> 03:44:12,887
This world will never change!
Who do you think -

2254
03:44:16,520 --> 03:44:18,409
You're hopeless!

2255
03:44:19,040 --> 03:44:21,168
Shameless and hopeless!

2256
03:44:46,600 --> 03:44:47,965
Ming.

2257
03:44:49,000 --> 03:44:50,570
Get up.

2258
03:44:52,520 --> 03:44:54,204
Quick, get up.

2259
03:44:55,160 --> 03:44:56,844
Get on your feet.

2260
03:44:57,920 --> 03:45:00,287
You won't die. Believe me.

2261
03:45:03,480 --> 03:45:05,926
Hurry and get UP-

2262
03:45:07,360 --> 03:45:09,283
You can do it.

2263
03:45:12,360 --> 03:45:14,522
Please get up.

2264
03:45:17,840 --> 03:45:19,410
Get up!

2265
03:45:23,440 --> 03:45:25,886
Why won't you get UP?

2266
03:45:31,400 --> 03:45:33,846
Where is he?

2267
03:45:33,960 --> 03:45:37,407
I'm looking for my brother.
You got the wrong person!

2268
03:45:37,560 --> 03:45:39,722
You've made a mistake!

2269
03:45:49,920 --> 03:45:52,002
You got the wrong person!

2270
03:45:54,240 --> 03:45:56,083
<i>Where's Sh'?</i>

2271
03:46:12,640 --> 03:46:14,927
So that's the guy.

2272
03:46:16,600 --> 03:46:18,648
Strange.
I don't know this one.

2273
03:46:19,320 --> 03:46:21,209
What gang is he with?

2274
03:46:22,440 --> 03:46:26,445
I know every one
of these assholes in town.

2275
03:46:35,440 --> 03:46:37,124
“Dear Sis...”

2276
03:46:37,280 --> 03:46:39,282
Found that in his pocket.

2277
03:46:41,200 --> 03:46:42,929
“I'm sorry.

2278
03:46:43,560 --> 03:46:46,404
I know you're the only one
who understands.

2279
03:46:46,520 --> 03:46:49,842
Please help explain
to Mom and Dad...

2280
03:46:50,960 --> 03:46:53,440
in case I never see you again.”

2281
03:46:55,480 --> 03:46:57,323
What's the little jerk's name?

2282
03:46:57,480 --> 03:47:00,290
Can't even write his name.
Drew a funny face!

2283
03:47:00,640 --> 03:47:02,642
What's his problem?

2284
03:47:03,480 --> 03:47:05,847
XIAO SFR

2285
03:47:14,920 --> 03:47:17,161
Get up.
Time to change.

2286
03:47:18,320 --> 03:47:19,890
Get up.

2287
03:47:20,000 --> 03:47:22,321
Get up and get changed!

2288
03:47:22,480 --> 03:47:24,562
You little punk!

2289
03:47:24,680 --> 03:47:26,728
She's mine!

2290
03:47:26,840 --> 03:47:29,764
You can't take her away!

2291
03:47:30,000 --> 03:47:32,606
You can't do this!

2292
03:47:46,400 --> 03:47:50,291
It belongs to my old man.
Ask him where he got it.

2293
03:47:50,400 --> 03:47:52,368
<i>I didn't ask him!</i>

2294
03:47:52,480 --> 03:47:53,891
I'm asking you!

2295
03:47:54,040 --> 03:47:56,202
Why'd you bring
this sword to class?

2296
03:47:58,000 --> 03:48:00,731
I know
you're mixed up in all this!

2297
03:48:01,800 --> 03:48:03,882
We know your father well.

2298
03:48:04,000 --> 03:48:06,048
Can't you just cooperate?

2299
03:48:06,200 --> 03:48:08,726
That's my son!
What are you doing to him?

2300
03:48:08,840 --> 03:48:11,764
This is outrageous!
We're a respectable family!

2301
03:48:12,120 --> 03:48:14,691
Treating an innocent child
like this!

2302
03:48:14,880 --> 03:48:16,564
The latest report:

2303
03:48:16,720 --> 03:48:18,643
The girl's mother
just committed suicide.

2304
03:48:18,760 --> 03:48:20,444
Who's in charge here?

2305
03:48:20,560 --> 03:48:22,562
I am! I'm the boss here!

2306
03:48:22,720 --> 03:48:24,404
Now you get out!

2307
03:48:24,520 --> 03:48:27,171
- How dare you speak to me like that!
- Out!

2308
03:48:27,280 --> 03:48:29,567
Who is that man?
I want his name!

2309
03:48:29,920 --> 03:48:31,649
What's his name?

2310
03:48:31,800 --> 03:48:33,564
Write down his name!

2311
03:48:44,280 --> 03:48:47,250
He was the only friend I had.

2312
03:48:48,920 --> 03:48:50,524
And now...

2313
03:49:18,120 --> 03:49:21,124
<i>We heard the girl's mother
tried to kill herself.</i>

2314
03:49:21,240 --> 03:49:23,242
<i>Tell us about it.</i>

2315
03:49:23,360 --> 03:49:25,249
<i>Let us talk to her.</i>

2316
03:49:25,360 --> 03:49:28,284
<i>Everyone wants to know
what really happened.</i>

2317
03:49:28,480 --> 03:49:31,450
<i>She tried to kill herself
by swallowing her gold ring.</i>

2318
03:49:31,560 --> 03:49:33,562
<i>I really don 'I know much else.</i>

2319
03:49:33,680 --> 03:49:35,444
<i>Please be considerate.</i>

2320
03:49:35,560 --> 03:49:37,688
<i>Do you know the boy?</i>

2321
03:49:37,800 --> 03:49:40,849
<i>Relax. The mother survived.
No big deal.</i>

2322
03:49:40,960 --> 03:49:43,645
I heard you had
an affair with the girl.

2323
03:49:43,760 --> 03:49:47,048
Any comment?
- We heard the same thing.

2324
03:49:47,160 --> 03:49:50,130
What?
Have you no decency?

2325
03:49:50,240 --> 03:49:53,210
Get out! All of you!

2326
03:49:54,320 --> 03:49:56,482
Who do you think you are?
Out!

2327
03:49:56,600 --> 03:49:58,762
He has a guilty conscience.

2328
03:49:58,880 --> 03:50:02,202
What's wrong
with asking a question?

2329
03:50:02,360 --> 03:50:05,842
Let's check out
the police department again.

2330
03:50:06,600 --> 03:50:13,848
<i>There is a place
of peace and calm</i>

2331
03:50:14,840 --> 03:50:19,971
<i>Safe in G0d's embrace</i>

2332
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:24,209
<i>In that place</i>

2333
03:50:24,600 --> 03:50:28,525
<i>No evil dwells</i>

2334
03:50:29,160 --> 03:50:34,405
<i>Safe in G0d's embrace</i>

2335
03:50:35,520 --> 03:50:42,529
<i>Jesus, our benevolent savior</i>

2336
03:50:43,760 --> 03:50:48,891
<i>Comes from G0d's embrace</i>

2337
03:50:49,760 --> 03:50:57,008
<i>We earnestly await the time</i>

2338
03:50:57,960 --> 03:51:03,569
<i>When we'll rest in G0d's embrace</i>

2339
03:51:05,000 --> 03:51:07,048
In the summer of 1961,

2340
03:51:07,160 --> 03:51:09,640
Xiao Si'r received
the death sentence

2341
03:51:09,760 --> 03:51:12,650
from the District Court of Taipei.

2342
03:51:12,800 --> 03:51:15,406
Being the first juvenile
homicide case in Taiwan

2343
03:51:15,560 --> 03:51:17,562
under Nationalist
government rule,

2344
03:51:17,680 --> 03:51:19,762
the case and sentence
were widely debated.

2345
03:51:19,920 --> 03:51:22,048
The District High Court
later commuted the sentence

2346
03:51:22,160 --> 03:51:23,844
to 15 years in prison.

2347
03:51:23,960 --> 03:51:27,248
Xiao Si'r was released from prison
shortly before his 30th birthday.

2348
03:51:27,360 --> 03:51:29,840
Two months after the incident...

2349
03:51:30,080 --> 03:51:33,687
The other gentlemen said
you accept tapes.

2350
03:51:36,240 --> 03:51:38,083
Who said that?

2351
03:51:39,600 --> 03:51:41,523
You're making it up.

2352
03:51:41,960 --> 03:51:43,928
We never accept tapes.

2353
03:51:44,080 --> 03:51:45,969
I wanted to leave a letter.

2354
03:51:46,120 --> 03:51:49,283
He said letters get lost easily
in the mail room.

2355
03:51:49,400 --> 03:51:51,767
He suggested a tape instead.

2356
03:51:57,440 --> 03:52:00,171
- Are you a family member?
- No.

2357
03:52:01,320 --> 03:52:04,290
Mister, didn't you say
you accept tapes?

2358
03:52:08,480 --> 03:52:10,448
Do you or don't you?

2359
03:52:10,640 --> 03:52:12,881
- Who's it for?
- Zhang Zhen.

2360
03:52:13,200 --> 03:52:14,929
All right.

2361
03:52:20,760 --> 03:52:23,081
Just leave it and go!

2362
03:52:26,480 --> 03:52:29,484
<i>Si'r, remember
this song I recorded?</i>

2363
03:52:29,960 --> 03:52:32,167
<i>Guess who I mailed it to.</i>

2364
03:52:32,440 --> 03:52:34,283
<i>Elvis!</i>

2365
03:52:34,440 --> 03:52:36,363
<i>He even wrote back.</i>

2366
03:52:36,480 --> 03:52:40,007
<i>He was surprised to learn
his music is so popular</i>

2367
03:52:40,160 --> 03:52:42,322
<i>on this unknown little island.</i>

2368
03:52:42,480 --> 03:52:46,690
<i>He was touched.
He even sent me a gift.</i>

2369
03:52:47,280 --> 03:52:49,408
<i>Too bad you can't see it.</i>

2370
03:52:49,520 --> 03:52:52,410
<i>I wear the ring
he sent me every day.</i>

2371
03:52:52,560 --> 03:52:54,642
<i>It's really cool!</i>

2372
03:52:55,320 --> 03:52:59,689
<i>I just don't know
when I 'II get to show it to you.</i>

2373
03:53:02,000 --> 03:53:04,685
What's this thing?

2374
03:53:04,880 --> 03:53:06,644
Shit!

2375
03:53:52,520 --> 03:53:54,761
Hey, the radio's working!

2376
03:53:55,400 --> 03:53:58,563
