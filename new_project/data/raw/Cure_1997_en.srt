00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:08,175
A DAIEI PRESENTATION

2
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,433
"Once upon a time...

3
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:21,272
in a forest lived a man
and his beautiful daughter.

4
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,275
One day...

5
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:29,071
a golden carriage drawn by six horses
stopped before their house.

6
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,408
Out of the carriage stepped a king.

7
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:38,622
'Would you give me your daughter
to be my wife?' he asked the man.

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,879
Delighted, the man agreed.

9
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,425
Truth be told,
the king was very handsome...

10
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,304
his only flaw being his beard,
which was blue.

11
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:59,894
Apart from this, there was no fault
to be found with him."

12
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,940
<i>BLUEBEARD</i>

13
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,527
<i>BLUEBEARD</i>

14
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:25,086
Enough of the book.
Let's talk about something else.

15
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,046
Yes, please.

16
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,048
- Feeling all right?
- Yes.

17
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,223
I know how...

18
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,975
the story ends.

19
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:47,191
In the end,
the daughter kills Bluebeard.

20
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,598
- You are?
- Takabe, from headquarters.

21
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,766
Thank you for coming.

22
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,312
Mr. Takabe,
do you want to see the cleaner...

23
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,772
- who found the body?
- No.

24
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:14,236
A prostitute. Something like this
was bound to happen someday.

25
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,866
- I'm Takabe.
- Yasukawa, from the precinct.

26
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,951
Find anything?

27
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,453
Yes.

28
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:05,329
If it was this Kuwano guy,
he took off in the raw.

29
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:10,167
And he left us his ID.

30
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,964
Excuse me.

31
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:28,435
She was struck with a blunt object,
but she died from loss of blood.

32
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,814
It wouldn't have taken long.

33
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,819
Both carotid arteries
have been neatly severed.

34
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,532
Have you ever seen wounds
like this before?

35
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:42,783
No.

36
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,535
I see.

37
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:49,206
But the perp is no ordinary character.

38
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:54,837
You don't have to go this far
just to kill someone.

39
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,385
The suspect may have
a motorcycle or a bicycle.

40
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:06,015
Check all the service roads.
I'm on my way.

41
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,778
I'm going to check out his neighborhood.
You want to come?

42
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,631
Takabe, here.

43
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:49,224
<i>Then there was blood everywhere.</i>

44
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,810
<i>Lots of it.</i>

45
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:55,230
Sakuma, this came
from the Shibaura Precinct.

46
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,489
<i>And then...</i>

47
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:08,285
<i>I looked at her face...</i>

48
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,499
He looks okay to me.

49
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,925
They've requested a psychiatrist.

50
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,843
What's the point?

51
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,764
So he's like the rest?

52
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:33,811
Yep. Admits intent,
then says afterwards he was stunned.

53
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:39,525
The devil made them do it
is all I can guess.

54
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,824
Three cases in two months.

55
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,244
What's going on?

56
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,955
The media don't know?

57
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,667
No. We haven't released any details.

58
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,670
No TV or book plots like this?

59
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,880
None. We checked.

60
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,008
There've been no leaks, either.

61
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,389
Unless you've said something
in one of your lectures.

62
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,391
Give me a break!

63
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:16,728
The perps aren't related in any way,
and they're all perfectly rational.

64
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,316
- So it just happened.
- "Just happened"?

65
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,738
People like to think
a crime has some meaning.

66
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,783
But most of them don't.

67
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,625
So somebody "just happened"
to do this?

68
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,087
Where is this?

69
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,590
Shirasato Beach.

70
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,618
Where is it?

71
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,495
Shirasato Beach.

72
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,330
Where?

73
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,499
Shirasato, in Chiba.

74
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,669
Shirasato? Where's that?

75
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,338
Where are you going?

76
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,133
Nowhere.

77
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,808
Yes?

78
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,393
What's the date?

79
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,479
February 26th.

80
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,566
Where is this?

81
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,693
I just told you!

82
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,904
When was that?

83
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,114
Just over there.

84
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:00,827
Eh, do you know who I am?

85
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,537
What?

86
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,875
I don't know who I am.

87
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,670
You what?

88
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,884
Help me.

89
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,678
Please.

90
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,764
I don't remember anything!

91
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,978
Could he use a drink?

92
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,855
No, coffee's fine.

93
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,108
Here.

94
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,783
What's that sound out there?

95
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,163
The waves.

96
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,171
It's so quiet.

97
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:03,640
'Mamiya' is written here.
Could that be your name?

98
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,518
I don't know.

99
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,646
You could be 'Mr. Mamiya.'

100
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,774
Mamiya?

101
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:19,448
That's fine.
Mamiya can be my name.

102
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,534
It probably is.

103
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,163
Maybe we should ask the police.

104
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,541
No. No police.

105
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,168
Why not?

106
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,346
Then let's talk some more.

107
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,558
Perhaps your family, your work.

108
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,687
First tell me about yourself.

109
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,857
Me?

110
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:58,570
I teach elementary school,
and I'm married. That's it.

111
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,740
Where's your wife?

112
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,241
Sleeping upstairs.

113
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,869
Why is she doing that?

114
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,871
She has a cold.

115
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,332
Who does?

116
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:21,551
Mr. Mamiya.

117
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,221
Who's that?

118
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,348
You, Mr. Mamiya.

119
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:42,239
Well, I've told you about me.
Now you tell me about you.

120
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:44,908
About me?

121
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,369
Anything.

122
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,664
Doesn't the name Mamiya
bring back anything?

123
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,251
No.

124
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,879
Why were you on the beach?

125
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,464
Where?

126
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,299
Shirasato Beach.

127
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,180
I don't know
what you're talking about!

128
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,435
Okay, let's talk about
something else then.

129
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,521
I want to hear about you.

130
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,315
I've already told you.

131
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,528
Yeah?

132
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,615
I don't remember.

133
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:32,664
I teach school.
There's just me and my wife.

134
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,209
What does your wife do?

135
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,545
Nothing. She's a housewife.

136
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,213
Who is?

137
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,215
My wife.

138
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:51,474
Oh, the woman in the pink negligee...

139
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,562
You saw her?

140
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:02,319
I don't remember anything.
You do.

141
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:18,668
Tell me more about your wife.

142
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,432
I'll be right back.

143
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,518
Hello. Could you give me a minute?

144
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,653
Bunch of idiots!

145
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,072
What did I do wrong?

146
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,658
I do things my way!

147
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,869
What? Go to hell!

148
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,666
Damn right I'm mad!
Stop fucking around, you dumb shit!

149
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,376
Sorry to keep you.

150
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,295
Here we are.

151
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,842
There you go.

152
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:08,927
Good. Thanks.

153
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,929
Thank you very much.

154
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,932
Mr. Takabe, one moment.

155
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,619
Hello.

156
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,788
Sorry. Did I wake you?

157
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,166
I'll do that.

158
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,625
No, I will...

159
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,170
No, I feel good today.

160
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,265
Where's the opener?

161
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,643
Here.

162
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:57,077
- I poured you some beer.
- Thanks.

163
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,880
How's work? Busy?

164
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,884
Yeah. How about you?

165
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:17,722
Me? I just did nothing all day long.

166
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,906
Fumie.

167
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,329
When this case is over,
let's take a trip somewhere.

168
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,666
Oh, that's all right...

169
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,169
No, I'd like to go somewhere.

170
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:54,384
We're definitely going.
You decide where.

171
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,636
Where?

172
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:01,349
I'll leave that up to you.
Okinawa, Hokkaido, anywhere.

173
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,728
From one extreme to the other.

174
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,732
You decide.

175
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,528
All right.

176
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,785
The victim is...

177
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:07,332
Tomoko Hanaoka, 26,
the suspect's wife.

178
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:10,168
Her carotid arteries were out.

179
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:18,051
'Suspect teaches elementary school.
Committed to his work, a good teacher.'

180
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:23,806
'High school classmates,
married two years.

181
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,184
'Neighbors describe them
as a fine couple.

182
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,812
'No trouble with debt or anything.'

183
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,815
The devil made him do it?

184
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,008
Mr. Hanaoka...

185
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:03,012
last night you killed
your wife Tomoko.

186
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,015
Is that correct?

187
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,185
Mr. Hanaoka?

188
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,942
You sliced her open with a knife...

189
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:20,029
from throat to chest.

190
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:23,950
Why?

191
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,037
Why did you kill her like that?

192
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:32,834
I don't know. Why did I do it?

193
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:38,214
Did you read some novel
or see some movie like that?

194
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,677
Did someone talk to you?

195
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,305
No.

196
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,726
I see.

197
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,815
Did you hate your wife?

198
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:04,032
Things weren't going well
between you, were they?

199
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,909
No, that's not true.

200
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,203
Then isn't it strange?

201
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,624
What is it, Mr. Hanaoka?

202
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,763
I remember everything.

203
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,809
I killed Tomoko.
At the time it just seemed...

204
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,938
the natural thing to do.

205
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,111
- Was there a quarrel?
- No.

206
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,074
It's weird. You murdered
your wife for no reason?

207
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,955
That's right.
There was no reason.

208
00:22:55,249 --> 00:23:00,171
But I killed her!
I killed Tomoko!

209
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:07,261
Mr. Hanaoka, crying won't help.

210
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:12,016
I'm going to keep on asking you
until you tell me.

211
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,937
- I'm sure this is hard for you...
- That's enough, Takabe.

212
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,564
- No.
- That's enough.

213
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,025
Take him.

214
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:27,031
He's not lying.
He remembers everything.

215
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,410
Chances are he's completely sane.

216
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,545
Hey! Stop that!

217
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:47,176
Would a person out someone up like that
because the devil made them do it?

218
00:23:55,226 --> 00:24:01,023
What if they all had some similar
trauma in their childhoods?

219
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:06,362
It lies suppressed for years,
then they explode.

220
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,322
Could that happen?

221
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,617
Since when did you become a shrink?

222
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:17,039
I've been reading up.
You know, my wife...

223
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,334
Don't laugh. Beginners' books.

224
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,631
Don't believe everything you read.

225
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,884
Well, it's in a book.

226
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:32,763
No one can understand
what motivates a criminal...

227
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,932
sometimes not even the criminal.

228
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:38,269
No one understands.

229
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,234
You're getting in too deep.

230
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:51,574
No. All I want is to find words
that will explain the crimes.

231
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,703
That's my job.

232
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,207
Yeah, I guess so.

233
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:05,004
How is your wife, by the way?

234
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,592
She's going to the hospital
you recommended.

235
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,513
She's a lot better.

236
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,515
Yeah?

237
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,936
At least, it seems that way.

238
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,772
I don't know if she really is.

239
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,442
Thank you very much.

240
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,777
That's all right.

241
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,321
- I might have to come again.
- You might?

242
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,616
Could you contact this officer
if someone else moves in?

243
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:36,035
- All right.
- Give him your number.

244
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:40,933
Hey, you!
What are you doing up there?

245
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:45,938
You'll get hurt! Come down!

246
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,784
I'm coming up!

247
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,290
Damn fool!

248
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,502
Name, address
and particulars unknown.

249
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:13,299
He appears to be in his late 20s.

250
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,219
Yes, I know that.

251
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,765
All right, thank you.

252
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,897
Well, the station is looking
for information on you...

253
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,608
but if you yourself don't know...

254
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,401
The computer has nothing either.

255
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:47,583
Don't worry.
Tomorrow we'll get you to a hospital.

256
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,919
Have some tea.

257
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,675
Is this your place?

258
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,637
No, it's a police box.

259
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,973
You're a cop?

260
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,600
Yes.

261
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,400
Why am I talking to you?

262
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,987
I want to ask you some questions.

263
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,617
About me?

264
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:28,165
Do you remember standing on that roof?

265
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:35,131
What about coming
to this police box with me?

266
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,137
Is this a police box?

267
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,014
Yes.

268
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:49,770
Who are you?

269
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,819
Oh, boy!

270
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,405
Okay, enough.

271
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,201
May I smoke?

272
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,578
Sure.

273
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,581
You can't smoke here!

274
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,166
That's okay.

275
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,301
Here.

276
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,762
I'm on duty.

277
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,014
Oh.

278
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,229
Here.

279
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,898
Oh, thanks.

280
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,235
I'll go do my rounds.

281
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,171
It must be hard work.

282
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,049
Sometimes.

283
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,403
I'm sleepy.

284
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,574
I'm gonna sleep a bit.

285
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,785
Okay.

286
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,193
Mr. Oida.

287
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,074
Look at this.

288
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,422
You hear me, don't you?

289
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,424
Yes.

290
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,969
You know what I'd like?

291
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,805
I'd like to hear about you.

292
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,974
Huh?

293
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,604
Tell me.

294
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,617
I think it's the flu.

295
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,081
Does your throat hurt?

296
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,833
A little.

297
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,505
Lower your trousers
and lie down, please.

298
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:04,924
What?

299
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,181
Lower your trousers and lie down.

300
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,391
Okay.

301
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,663
That's good enough.

302
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,585
Raise your knees a bit.

303
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,551
You're not shy, are you!

304
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,972
Your lymph glands are a bit swollen.

305
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:54,807
Fine, thank you.

306
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,625
What do you want at this hour?

307
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,794
Sorry. This won't take long.

308
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,674
Ten minutes, and that's all!

309
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,343
Listen...

310
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:35,180
you don't think it might be
some kind of hypnosis, do you?

311
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:36,682
Huh?

312
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:40,102
You know, someone looks
at a flashing light...

313
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,105
then does whatever
someone else tells them?

314
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,649
'Hypnotic suggestion.'

315
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,237
Is it possible?
What do you think?

316
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,824
You're the only one I dare ask.

317
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,076
Well?

318
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,828
Got some new evidence?

319
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,122
Just an idea.

320
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:06,378
Hypnotism itself is
a very common technique.

321
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:10,340
But even if you manage
to hypnotize someone...

322
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,927
you can't change
their basic moral sense.

323
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:18,140
A person who thinks murder is evil
won't kill anyone...

324
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,768
under hypnotic suggestion.

325
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:33,614
Could you induce someone to cut
in that 'X' pattern?

326
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,870
It would take forever to get
a suggestion like that into place.

327
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,413
It's impossible?

328
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,207
I didn't say that...

329
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,418
if the hypnotist was a genius.

330
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,963
But why would someone do that?

331
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:52,674
I don't know.

332
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:57,846
A thrill killing?
Some thrill that'd be!

333
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:04,103
You said yourself that no one knows
what motivates a criminal.

334
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,573
Mr. Oida, do you know where the stuff
for the Ward Office is?

335
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,616
The right-hand shelf.

336
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,787
Yeah, here it is.

337
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,372
Like I said.

338
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,632
Be right back.

339
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:09,895
Come in.

340
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:14,399
Sorry I'm late.

341
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,819
That's all right.
Did something happen?

342
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,363
I got lost.

343
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,989
Lost?

344
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,532
Yes.

345
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,160
Did you come another way?

346
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:31,124
I don't know. Suddenly I just
didn't know where I was.

347
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,378
How did you get here, then?

348
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:36,922
I don't know.

349
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,677
Suddenly I was in front
of the hospital.

350
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,180
Well, it all worked out
for the best.

351
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:46,932
You got here.

352
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,350
Yes.

353
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,185
That book...

354
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:55,440
It's 'Bluebeard'.
Do you remember it?

355
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,697
No, I've never seen it before.

356
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,374
There's nothing physically wrong.

357
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:17,379
Just a sprained ankle.
Nothing to worry about.

358
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:23,010
So how's your memory?

359
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:33,562
Tomorrow we'll move you to a hospital
with a proper psychiatric department.

360
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:35,897
Sure.

361
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:49,828
How far back do you remember?

362
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,585
I remember talking to you.

363
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,836
Any worries?

364
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,464
Worries? About what?

365
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,342
You're quite calm.

366
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,140
You're the one with worries.

367
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:12,476
Sorry?

368
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,562
May I smoke?

369
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,773
There's no smoking here.

370
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,566
I see.

371
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,326
What do you mean, I have worries?

372
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,997
Eh, what?

373
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:36,583
I forget.

374
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,591
Water.

375
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:25,424
Doctor, can I tell you something?

376
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,677
Certainly.

377
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:34,057
All the things that
used to be inside me...

378
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,643
now they're all outside.

379
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,063
So...

380
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:46,194
I can see all of the things
inside you, Doctor.

381
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:51,658
But the inside of me...

382
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,911
is empty.

383
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:30,405
Don't look at me.

384
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:39,414
Now you tell me about yourself.

385
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:43,627
About me? What about me?

386
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,422
Why you became a doctor.

387
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,424
Why?

388
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,887
You're just a woman.
Why did you become a doctor?

389
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,598
Just a woman?

390
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:05,190
That's what people said, isn't it?

391
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,027
They did, didn't they?

392
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,364
Think back.

393
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:16,868
Remember exactly how you felt.

394
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,623
Just a woman.

395
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:30,674
Woman is a lower life form
than man. Isn't she?

396
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:41,351
See? Now you remember.

397
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,647
When you were in medical school...

398
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:51,152
you dissected a corpse, didn't you?

399
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,615
The first corpse you'd ever seen.

400
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,451
It was a man, wasn't it?

401
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,122
Think back.

402
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,126
You'd never seen a naked man before.

403
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:11,673
You took your scalpel
and out into him.

404
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:18,138
It made you feel good, didn't it?

405
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:21,182
Didn't it?

406
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:23,351
Think back.

407
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,397
You wanted to be a surgeon...

408
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,861
but you weren't sure you could,
and you ended up a GP.

409
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:35,864
No.

410
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:42,412
What you really wanted to do
was cut a man open.

411
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,937
You shot him in the head.

412
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,940
Wasn't that enough?

413
00:44:54,776 --> 00:45:00,740
Is there a reason why you cut
into the dead man with a knife?

414
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:03,368
Yes.

415
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:07,789
He was someone I didn't like.

416
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:09,332
Why?

417
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,835
Many reasons.

418
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:18,508
It's been three years since
he was transferred to our box.

419
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,594
I put up with him all the time.

420
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:27,308
Finally I couldn't stand it anymore.

421
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,185
But to kill him?

422
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:31,187
Yes.

423
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:36,609
Detective, you've never
killed anyone, have you?

424
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:43,283
That's how you get when you hate
someone from the bottom of your heart.

425
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:46,369
So it was an angry impulse?

426
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:50,206
No. I was completely calm.

427
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:56,546
Isn't that a bit strange?

428
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:01,342
Yes, it definitely is strange.

429
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,803
May I?

430
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:08,892
I'm Sakuma, a psychiatrist.

431
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:14,189
Officer Oida, do you remember
seeing anything shiny?

432
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:15,815
For example...

433
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:19,027
something like this?

434
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,197
No.

435
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:27,202
Were you talking to anyone
before the crime?

436
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,370
No.

437
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:35,376
Is that true? Try to remember.

438
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:39,380
Do you think you could
stop doing that, please?

439
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,049
Keep going.

440
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,051
Don't stop!

441
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:47,347
You did talk to someone, didn't you?

442
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:50,558
We know you did.
Look at the light.

443
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,061
No. No one.

444
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,396
Yes, you did. Who was it?

445
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:57,440
What was his name?

446
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:59,067
I didn't!

447
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:02,821
- Enough!
- Mr. Oida.

448
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:08,785
You must have seen a light like this.

449
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:10,578
Was anyone there?

450
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,166
Someone told you to do this,
didn't they?

451
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,336
Who was it?

452
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:24,801
There might have been someone there.

453
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,928
- Was there?
- I don't know!

454
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:30,598
Of course you know.
Who was it?

455
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,309
Tell me his name, please.

456
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:39,315
- His name?
- Yes, his name. What was his name?

457
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,862
He... didn't have a name.

458
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:48,366
What do you mean?
Mr. Oida, look at the light!

459
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:49,868
That's enough!

460
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:09,345
Excuse me. I'm thirsty.

461
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,733
It is hypnosis!

462
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,110
We can't be sure of that.

463
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,529
But that wasn't normal!

464
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,990
I decide what's normal.

465
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,993
Stop traumatizing people.

466
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:37,332
Sakuma, we're not counseling this man,
we're interrogating him!

467
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:54,766
- Don't move!
- But...

468
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,601
Just stay there.

469
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,311
Mr. Oida? Mr. Oida?

470
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:45,108
What was that you just did?

471
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:48,569
Just now? Nothing.

472
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,114
What's that motion
you're making with your hand?

473
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:55,034
This?

474
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:01,833
I don't know.

475
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,420
Nothing in particular.

476
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,589
Tell me about what you just did.

477
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:18,349
I was just thinking
of Officer Tamura.

478
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:22,603
That's all.

479
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,608
Nothing more than that.

480
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,036
How long will this go on?

481
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,081
Okay.

482
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,047
<i>Mr. Takabe!</i>

483
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:35,843
What are you doing?

484
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:39,055
Another murder. The restrooms
in Chuo Park. Get over there.

485
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:45,186
<i>There was a report of a suspicious
person at Shiomicho Hospital.</i>

486
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:47,855
<i>Oida took him in there.</i>

487
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,662
- Amnesia?
- Apparently.

488
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:05,832
- Where is he?
- He's not in his room.

489
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:08,876
- So where is he?
- They say he hasn't left.

490
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:10,188
I know you're here.

491
00:53:20,573 --> 00:53:22,867
Step out here, please.

492
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:27,121
- Where?
- Here.

493
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,375
I don't know where "here" is.

494
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:35,421
Well, then, I'll have to come to you.

495
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:49,810
Where are you?

496
00:53:51,646 --> 00:53:53,064
Come out.

497
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:56,067
Who are you?

498
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,739
Police.

499
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,574
Who?

500
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:06,118
A police officer.

501
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,831
Do you understand my question?

502
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:16,170
I've got some questions to ask you.

503
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,760
I want to hear about you.

504
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,596
I ask the questions! You answer!

505
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:29,183
Who are you?

506
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,602
Where are you?

507
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,564
- Who are you?
- A detective!

508
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,193
Stop screwing around!

509
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,622
Name?

510
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,626
<i>I forget.</i>

511
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:01,173
Address? Age? Occupation?

512
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:03,968
<i>Don't know.</i>

513
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:10,725
When were you checked in?

514
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,020
Where?

515
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:15,813
The hospital.

516
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,399
Shiomicho Hospital.

517
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:22,194
You saw Dr. Miyajima.

518
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,241
Where?

519
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:31,829
We're going in circles!

520
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:57,063
Have you ever met
any of these people?

521
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,567
I don't remember.

522
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:10,618
How about this person?

523
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:18,042
I don't know.

524
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:21,003
This is you.

525
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:40,606
It looks like me.

526
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:43,401
So now we're sure of one thing.

527
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:46,195
That's you. All right?

528
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,407
I don't know him.

529
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:53,202
So this is me?

530
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,626
Who are you?

531
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:05,172
A detective. How about these?

532
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:12,888
Corpses.

533
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,518
- Do you like these?
- No.

534
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:23,023
If you don't like them,
why do you have them?

535
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:24,900
It's my job.

536
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,570
Job?

537
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:31,115
What's your job?

538
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:35,536
Right now, asking you questions.

539
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,873
Why?

540
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,668
You're an important source
of information.

541
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:46,839
Me? Why?

542
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:54,388
We found your fingerprints
at the Hanaoka house.

543
00:57:54,555 --> 00:58:00,060
Whether you remember or not,
you know him.

544
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:06,400
Oh, is that what you mean?

545
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:11,780
You know a lot, Detective.

546
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:15,075
Not what's inside your head.

547
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:18,162
My head?

548
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:26,629
Here?

549
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:34,178
Your attitude
isn't helping you at all.

550
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,514
Why?

551
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:41,185
Right. I want you to try
and remember from the beginning.

552
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:47,566
You admit you were
in Shiomicho Hospital?

553
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:51,612
What's wrong?
Why are you raising your voice?

554
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,031
Because you won't answer.

555
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:57,117
- Why?
- Answer my questions.

556
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:59,036
May I smoke?

557
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,999
- No!
- Takabe.

558
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,340
Detective?

559
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:13,968
Yes?

560
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:19,139
Tell me more about yourself.

561
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,810
After you talk.

562
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,980
Stop it! Leave him alone!

563
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:37,575
I need to examine him...

564
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:41,370
but I see clear symptoms
of typical psychosis.

565
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,832
Don't get into it with him.

566
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:48,377
You'll just get angry.

567
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:00,639
Hey, you all right?

568
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,766
Yeah. I'm all right.

569
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:25,849
I went out to the convenience store,
and I got lost.

570
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:28,769
I see.

571
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,064
We'll need toothbrushes.

572
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:35,067
We will, won't we?

573
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:40,447
What if we stay at a hotel...

574
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:44,076
where they don't give you one?

575
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:55,462
I'll do the shopping, okay?

576
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:02,177
You're tired.

577
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,639
You don't have to do
everything for me.

578
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:13,439
We don't have to take a trip, either.

579
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:21,405
We'll take that trip. Definitely.

580
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:25,617
My next holiday.

581
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,667
For sure.

582
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:36,837
Hey.

583
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:39,381
Impound all that guy's stuff.

584
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:43,427
But he's a witness, not a suspect.

585
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:45,429
I don't care. The works.

586
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:02,362
What's that?

587
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:06,241
A scar from a burn.
Not very old.

588
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:09,369
Possibly caused
by contact with metal.

589
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:12,206
Something round and hot.

590
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:14,374
Round and hot.

591
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:48,408
This way.

592
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:06,176
No one's home.

593
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,387
- Do you have the key?
- Yeah.

594
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:15,018
Is Mr. Mamiya
in some kind of trouble?

595
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,020
That's what I'm here to find out.

596
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:19,815
I see. Well, it's all yours.

597
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:23,569
Excuse me.

598
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,822
When did you last see Mr. Mamiya?

599
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:30,826
About six months ago, maybe.

600
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,662
I don't come out here much.

601
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:36,582
He paid a year's rent in advance.

602
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:39,376
I'll be downstairs if you need me.

who our man is.

613
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,539
Kunihiko Mamiya.

614
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:26,126
A psychology student
up until three years ago.

615
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:31,506
His professors said he hardly
showed up for classes.

616
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,176
Yeah, just like you.

617
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:39,514
Then he was a live-in part-timer
at a junkyard in Kawasaki.

618
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:43,560
That's probably where he got burned.

619
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:45,937
Vanished six months ago.

620
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:50,567
No, I don't know what he was doing.

621
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:56,281
Have you ever heard of 'Mesmer'?

622
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:05,540
Okay. Tell me when I get back.

623
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:22,826
What's wrong?
What happened?

624
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:31,293
Don't scare me like that!
Are you ill?

625
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,130
Why are you home now?

626
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,383
It's nothing.

627
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:42,137
He's ill. I've moved him
to the hospital.

628
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,931
- On whose authority?
- My own.

629
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,268
- Are you trying to take him away from me?
- That's right.

630
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:52,105
It's dangerous to let you
keep talking to that man.

631
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:55,108
You bastard!

632
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:59,738
- Hey! What about Mesmer?
- I'll ask him!

633
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:11,583
No one's supposed to see him.

634
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:14,794
Open up.

635
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,057
Move.

636
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:49,829
What's wrong?
Your hands are shaking.

637
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,588
I found out.

638
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:04,719
Your name is Mamiya Kunihiko.

639
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,931
Is that right?

640
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:12,644
Mamiya, who is this man
called Mesmer?

641
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:14,729
Who?

642
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,564
Mesmer.

643
01:11:18,233 --> 01:11:21,820
At the university
you studied about Mesmer...

644
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:24,739
and hypnotic suggestion.

645
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:26,866
What?

646
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,370
Whether you remember or not...

647
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:36,960
I'm going to have you arraigned
on charges of incitement to murder.

648
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,422
It's over.

649
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:49,556
You saw your wife dead, didn't you?

650
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:59,983
Your wife is ill, isn't she?

651
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:05,030
Is it hard caring for her at home?

652
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:11,161
Where did you hear about that?

653
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,789
The other detective told me.

654
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:22,547
Does it bother you,
talking about your wife?

655
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:33,767
Anyway, there'll be lots of time.

656
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:38,063
You can't get out of here.

657
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:39,939
It's you who wants out.

658
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,816
I know what you did.

659
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:46,613
Tell me whatever you like.
That's why you came, isn't it?

660
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:55,622
You planted hypnotic suggestions
in those people's minds.

661
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:58,917
It's hard to be a detective
with a crazy wife.

662
01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:00,293
shut up!

663
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:05,006
You do it by keeping your work
and your home life completely separate.

664
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,800
How did you do it?

665
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:10,261
The detective or the husband...

666
01:13:10,387 --> 01:13:11,930
which is the real you?

667
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:14,140
How did you hypnotize them?

668
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:16,810
Neither one is the real you.

669
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:19,938
There is no real you.

670
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,565
Your wife knows that, too.

671
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,567
How did you hypnotize them?

672
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:27,737
Watch.

673
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,660
You're right.

674
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:38,873
My wife is a burden. I know.
You don't have to tell me!

675
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:42,836
I'm a detective.

676
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:47,966
I've been taught never to show
emotion, even with my family.

677
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:50,969
And this is the result!

678
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:59,060
I don't understand her.

679
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:02,188
She doesn't understand
what I go through.

680
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:06,359
I know it's my fault
that it's that way. So what?

681
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:08,027
What else could you do?

682
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:11,114
That's right!
What other way is there?

683
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:16,369
Look...

684
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:21,374
You think this is how
I wanted to end up?

685
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:26,546
We should all relax, enjoy ourselves,
lead peaceful lives.

686
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,923
But society isn't like that!

687
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:33,720
Oh, so society's to blame...

688
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,931
It's people like you.

689
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:44,272
It's guys like you who have
my head about to split open!

690
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:52,071
Lunatics like you have it easy
while citizens like me go through hell.

691
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:57,202
I spend my whole life
taking care of that wife of mine!

692
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,221
If it weren't for you...

693
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:21,726
things would be fine
with my wife and me.

694
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:28,399
Her I can forgive...

695
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:33,321
but you I can't.

696
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,250
You're amazing.

697
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,762
You like that? Hearing me talk?

698
01:15:58,304 --> 01:15:59,556
Yeah.

699
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,519
Good.

700
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:07,981
Now it's your turn.
I want the whole story.

701
01:16:10,108 --> 01:16:11,818
All of it.

702
01:16:16,698 --> 01:16:18,116
What's wrong?

703
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:24,539
Can't talk without your lighter?

704
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:31,921
Here.

705
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,265
You're amazing, you are.

706
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:42,408
The water will make you calm.

707
01:17:46,788 --> 01:17:51,167
It will make you happy, empty.

708
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:58,424
You'll be born again, just like me.

709
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,613
Are you all right?

710
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,782
Was it you?

711
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:26,285
Did you tell him about me?

712
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:31,541
Oh, well, you know,
he keeps asking all these questions...

713
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:47,640
Mesmer was an 18th-century
Austrian doctor...

714
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:50,935
the first man to study hypnosis.

715
01:18:52,562 --> 01:18:55,940
It wasn't recognized then
as a medical treatment.

716
01:18:56,733 --> 01:19:01,070
They saw it as fakery, magic...

717
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:02,989
or witchcraft.

718
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,159
And?

719
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:09,579
There's still a lot
we don't know about Mesmer.

720
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:13,833
Some say he really did study
magic and alchemy.

721
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,796
And Mamiya's doing that?

722
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,132
Impossible.

723
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,009
If so...

724
01:19:23,885 --> 01:19:26,888
the diagnosis would be simple.

725
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:31,601
He'd simply be a megalomaniac.

726
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:34,395
But that's not it.

727
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:39,776
He has definitely lost his memory,
but otherwise he's not abnormal.

728
01:19:40,777 --> 01:19:45,782
But he's also a man
with a very complex personality.

729
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:50,703
I see. Okay.

730
01:19:57,794 --> 01:19:59,212
Takabe...

731
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:02,715
Don't talk to him.

732
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:05,802
You don't know what could happen.

733
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:09,055
Don't get in too deep.

734
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:11,933
I know.

735
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:47,760
Takabe.

736
01:20:55,101 --> 01:21:01,023
Mr. Mamiya, could you tell us
your name or date of birth?

737
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,860
Anything you remember.

738
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:11,742
Well?

739
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:15,413
Do you remember
anything about yourself?

740
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:20,960
No.

741
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:22,837
Mr. Mamiya...

742
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:27,800
are you aware of the situation
you are in at present?

743
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:32,972
I mean the charges against you.

744
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,309
Who are you?

745
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:39,478
Fujiwara, from headquarters.

746
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,315
Well, Mr. Mamiya?

747
01:21:43,274 --> 01:21:47,612
Do you understand
why you're here now?

748
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,447
What?

749
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:52,283
Don't ask questions, answer them.

750
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:53,826
What questions?

751
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,661
Mr. Mamiya...

752
01:21:56,370 --> 01:22:00,166
incitement to murder
can carry the death penalty.

753
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,377
Do you understand that?

754
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:05,379
Is that your boss?

755
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:07,173
Yes.

756
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:10,801
That must be a drag.

757
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:14,180
Mr. Mamiya, answer my question.

758
01:22:14,931 --> 01:22:16,515
Who are you?

759
01:22:17,642 --> 01:22:19,143
Fujiwara. Headquarters.

760
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:20,394
Who?

761
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,730
- Are you being smart?
- Who are you?

762
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:29,403
Takabe, what's wrong with this man?

763
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:32,365
- I'm asking who you are.
- Answer my question!

764
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:37,036
All right, I'll ask you again.

765
01:22:38,746 --> 01:22:40,665
Fujiwara-of-Headquarters.

766
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:43,417
Who are you?

767
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:49,882
What exactly do you mean?

768
01:22:51,968 --> 01:22:54,220
You think about that.

769
01:23:00,226 --> 01:23:01,769
I'm very sorry!

770
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:05,731
You must understand, he has amnesia.

771
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:10,611
What a bunch.

772
01:23:14,782 --> 01:23:17,326
They don't understand, do they?

773
01:23:19,245 --> 01:23:20,579
About me...

774
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:22,873
or about you.

775
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:32,425
Detective, do you hear my voice?

776
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:37,054
You do, don't you?

777
01:23:39,432 --> 01:23:43,769
That proves you're a special person.

778
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:49,650
You knew that from the start.

779
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:53,654
So did I.

780
01:23:55,823 --> 01:23:58,200
You're different from them.

781
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:03,789
You're someone...

782
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:09,628
who can understand
what I'm really saying.

783
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:17,261
Take him away.

784
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:36,734
Will Okinawa be warm?

785
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:42,406
Let's eat lots of good food.

786
01:26:44,742 --> 01:26:47,244
What do you want to eat?

787
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:53,626
Fumie, we're not going to Okinawa.

788
01:26:55,044 --> 01:26:56,337
I know.

789
01:27:05,179 --> 01:27:09,683
The sea there must be beautiful.

790
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:18,525
Just until my work settles down.

791
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,195
I understand.

792
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:23,197
I'll take her bag.

793
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:25,783
Shall we go?

794
01:27:30,788 --> 01:27:33,499
Thank you, Doctor.

795
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:37,711
Mr. Takabe.

796
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:42,007
It's not good to work too hard.

797
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:48,931
You look sicker than your wife to me.

798
01:27:55,646 --> 01:28:00,025
I'm sorry, I don't have the tag.
I wonder where it went.

799
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:02,528
A week ago, wasn't it?

800
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:03,821
Yes.

801
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:06,740
Mr. Takabe?

802
01:28:06,824 --> 01:28:09,118
One moment, please.

803
01:28:27,011 --> 01:28:29,722
I'm sorry, sir, but it's not here.

804
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:32,599
That can't be.

805
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:37,021
Maybe you took it somewhere else?

806
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:38,230
No.

807
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:40,566
Or you gave it to your wife.

808
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:41,775
No.

809
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:53,579
May I take your plate?

810
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:56,623
Yes.

811
01:29:06,467 --> 01:29:07,760
Yeah?

812
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:10,471
Sakuma?

813
01:29:11,889 --> 01:29:13,223
What?

814
01:29:14,892 --> 01:29:16,685
No, I'm not busy.

815
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,521
Now?

816
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:28,364
I want to show you something.

817
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:29,990
What?

818
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:34,370
A film on hypnotherapy.
The university put it on video.

819
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:43,128
The oldest material
on hypnotism in Japan.

820
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:49,385
It probably dates from the end
of the 19th century.

821
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,940
Watch the man's hand.

822
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:10,406
You have to look closely.
See? There.

823
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:14,034
You see what looks like an X?

824
01:30:28,298 --> 01:30:31,176
- That's it?
- Yeah.

825
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,178
What does it mean?

826
01:30:33,846 --> 01:30:38,684
Her name was Suzu Murakawa.
She was treated for hysteria.

827
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:41,478
That's all that's recorded.

828
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:45,899
Police records say...

829
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:54,366
she was arrested
for the murder of her son in 1898.

830
01:30:57,286 --> 01:31:01,039
She seems to have killed him...

831
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:06,170
by carving the shape
of a cross into his neck.

832
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,382
That's all we know.

833
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:14,386
Did Mamiya see this film?

834
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:16,805
I don't know.

835
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:21,059
There's not much chance
even medical students would see it.

836
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:26,148
But even if he had...

837
01:31:27,566 --> 01:31:32,154
that still wouldn't
explain his actions.

838
01:31:36,909 --> 01:31:39,661
Who's this man in the film?

839
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,372
Unknown.

840
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:48,420
We do know, however, why he
didn't show his face to the camera.

841
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:56,303
You know what they called
hypnotism in Japan back then?

842
01:31:59,306 --> 01:32:00,766
'Soul conjuring.'

843
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:05,604
Like clairvoyance, spiritualism...
that sort of thing.

844
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:13,320
The authorities in any age
always suppress occultism...

845
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:20,577
and the Meiji government back then
would have suppressed this technique.

846
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:27,543
It would only have been performed
in secret ceremonies.

847
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:16,508

849
01:35:18,505 --> 01:35:20,132
Sakuma.

850
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:30,934
Huh?

851
01:35:31,727 --> 01:35:35,439
So what is Mamiya, then?

852
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:39,860
What's your guess? Tell me.

853
01:35:42,028 --> 01:35:43,739
A missionary.

854
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:46,324
A missionary?

855
01:35:47,576 --> 01:35:50,871
Sent to propagate the ceremony.

856
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:59,755
Sorry, I was just imagining things.

857
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:03,884
What am I saying?

858
01:36:04,593 --> 01:36:07,512
Don't take me seriously.

859
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:11,099
I'm a little tired.

860
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,394
Let's call it a day.

861
01:36:15,187 --> 01:36:18,190
Now I'm getting in too deep!

862
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:31,328
Sakuma, what's that?

863
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:42,339
Oh, that?

864
01:36:43,215 --> 01:36:46,718
I just thought it might
help me to think.

865
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:48,804
About what?

866
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:52,265
About...

867
01:36:54,935 --> 01:36:56,436
I don't know.

868
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:05,070
You met Mamiya, didn't you?

869
01:37:05,195 --> 01:37:06,571
No.

870
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:09,282
Yes, you did.

871
01:37:11,284 --> 01:37:12,744
It's weird.

872
01:37:14,830 --> 01:37:16,581

878
01:39:40,225 --> 01:39:41,601
Hello?

879
01:39:42,394 --> 01:39:44,229
One moment, please.

880
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:47,232
Mr. Takabe, it's for you.

881
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:49,859
Hello?

882
01:39:51,861 --> 01:39:53,321
I see.

883
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:57,158
We're on our way.

884
01:40:23,268 --> 01:40:26,813
Dr. Sakuma's body has been
taken to the hospital.

885
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:32,652
It was probably suicide.
He strangled himself.

886
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:36,656
He'd cuffed himself to that pipe...

887
01:40:37,657 --> 01:40:39,659
strange as that sounds.

888
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:43,259
So you've come, Detective.

889
01:43:56,064 --> 01:43:58,358
Why did you let me escape?

890
01:44:03,112 --> 01:44:04,614
You know why?

891
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:12,163
By letting me escape,
you could learn my true secret.

892
01:44:13,498 --> 01:44:15,166
All by yourself.

893
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:22,507
You didn't have to, though.

894
01:44:24,634 --> 01:44:30,932

his true self is bound to come here.

Remember now?

897
01:44:57,041 --> 01:44:59,961
Do you remember everything?

898
01:45:08,011 --> 01:45:09,512
You do?
